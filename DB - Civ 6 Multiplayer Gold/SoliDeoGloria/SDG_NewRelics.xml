At Athens the supposed remains of Oedipus and Theseus enjoyed an honour which it is very difficult to distinguish from a religious cult (see for all this Pfister, "Reliquienkult in Altertum", I, 1909), while Plutarch gives an account of the translation of the bodies of Demetrius (Demetr. iii) and Phocion (Phoc. xxxvii) which in many details anticipates the Christian practice of the Middle Ages. 
The bones or ashes of Aesculapius at Epidaurus, of Perdiccas I at Macedon, and even−if we may trust the statement of the Chronicon Paschale (Dindorf, p. 67)−of the Persian Zoroaster (Zarathustra), were treated with the deepest veneration. 
As for the Far East, the famous story of the distribution of the relics of Buddha, an incident which is believed to have taken place immediately after his death, seems to have found remarkable confirmation in certain modern archaeological discoveries. (See "Journ. of R. Asiatic Society", 1909, pp. 1056 sqq.). 
In any case the extreme development of relic-worship amongst the Buddhists of every sect is a fact beyond dispute.
