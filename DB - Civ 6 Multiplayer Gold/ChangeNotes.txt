COULDNT FIGURE OUT
By default, deselect Valetta from City State list
By default, deselect the OP natural wonders

MORE FOGGY
remove info about enemy from combat previews
no info on health, ggs, promotions, abilities, religion
having an adjacent scout allows a proper combat preview (or just health?)
remove red dots from enemy ggs

BETTER WARFARE
Melee attacks from City and Encampment tiles -10 (from Better Warfare)
What if sieging caused starvation? (i.e. citizens can't work a tile occupied by an enemy unit)

NEED TO CODE
Civilopedia info page that lists all GOLD options and whether they're enabled or not
Policies panel for religious beliefs: assumes all your cities follow your religion
New belief selection screens? Show calculated yields? (include all my cities and/or all my believing cities) Show beliefs already taken?
Make screen of "things taken" and get rid of notifications on, say, wonders, great people, etc. Shows turn taken, but not who
Add "P" to keybinding list for adding a pin
Button/hotkey to pin all enemy units... erases former pins and places new ones on all seen bad guys (or option to auto do it at end of turn)
Battle notifications drop pins on attackers, nukes, dead units
Notification when Great People/Scouts are killed (or drop a pin)
Stonehenge thinks it gives Atlas a benefit
Homing Torpedoes gives +10 on defense but should be +7
Show breakdown of your own Cities' Defense Strength on hover [Like +3 Walls, +5 Palace/Gustav, +3 Hills, +4 Districts]
City center tiles get deep fog of war when not in vision
Add Support calculation to unit tooltip (note that it's only melee attacks)
Integrate better war weariness statistics (its own report page?)
Unit Table from Better Civilopedia? (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1341630847)
Music selector [When you click another civ leader icon (for diplomacy), you hear their music. There should be a way to do that outside of the diplomacy screen.]

NEED TO TEST


===DONE===
BETTER WARFARE
- Recon units (skirmishers, rangers, spec ops) are stealth by default and have better promotions, but much lower melee strength (defending strength)
BETTER TRADE ROUTES
- Remove minimum time length (i.e., for short routes, the trader is done after going there and back once)
BETTER SCOUTS
- Survey policy now gives +1 sight (was +100% XP from discovering natural wonders and huts)
PANTHEON OBELISK
- Pantheon Obelisk costs 250 (was 180)
- God King policy give +30% production (was +20%)
UNITS HIDE IN TREES
- Bugfix: scouts, skirmishers, rangers, and spec ops no longer lose their stealth when they walk out of trees
