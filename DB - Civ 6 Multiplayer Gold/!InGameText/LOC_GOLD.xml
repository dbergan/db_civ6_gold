But let us consider; although God has made Nature to operate by certain fixed laws, yet it is not unreasonable to think that he may suspend those laws in order to establish a system highly advantageous to mankind. Now the Christian Religion is a most beneficial system, as it gives us light and certainty where we were before in darkness and doubt. The miracles which prove it are attested by men who had no interest in deceiving us; but who, on the contrary, were told that they should suffer persecution, and did actually lay down their lives in confirmation of the truth of the facts which they asserted. Indeed, for some centuries the heathens did not pretend to deny the miracles; but said they were performed by the aid of evil spirits. This is a circumstance of great weight.</Text></Row>

There must be an opening from below as well as an outpouring from above, the receptiveness of the lower nature as well as the willingness of the higher to give. That is the link between the Christ and the man; that is what the churches have called the outpouring of "divine grace"; that is what is meant by the "faith" necessary to make the grace effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Giordano Bruno once put it—the human soul has windows, and can shut those windows close. The sun outside is shining, the light is unchanging; let the windows be opened and the sunlight must stream in.

There are all sorts of things in this world that offer to give it to you, but they never quite keep their promise. The longings which arise in us when we first fall in love, or first think of some foreign country, or first take up some subject that excites us, are longings which no marriage, no travel, no learning, can really satisfy. There was something we grasped at, in that first moment of longing, which just fades away in the reality.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.</Text></Row>

Having first prepared himself by means of the purifying vapor-bath, and cast off as far as possible all human or fleshly influences, the young man sought out the noblest height, the most commanding summit in all the surrounding region. Knowing that God sets no value upon material things, he took with him no offerings or sacrifices other than symbolic objects, such as paints and tobacco. Wishing to appear before Him in all humility, he wore no clothing save his moccasins and breech-clout. At the solemn hour of sunrise or sunset he took up his position, overlooking the glories of earth and facing the "Great Mystery," and there he remained, naked, erect, silent, and motionless, exposed to the elements and forces of His arming, for a night and a day to two days and nights, but rarely longer. Sometimes he would chant a hymn without words, or offer the ceremonial "filled pipe." In this holy trance or ecstasy the Native American mystic found his highest happiness and the motive power of his existence.</Text></Row>

Alone of all creeds, Christianity has added courage to the virtues of the Creator. For the only courage worth calling courage must necessarily mean that the soul passes a breaking point—and does not break. In the account of Christ's suffering, there is a distinct emotional suggestion that the author of all things (in some unthinkable way) went not only through agony, but through doubt. It is written, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." No; but the Lord thy God may tempt Himself; and it seems as if this was what happened in Gethsemane. When the world shook and the sun was wiped out of heaven, it was not at the crucifixion, but at the cry from the cross: the cry which confessed that God was forsaken of God.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And now let the revolutionists choose a creed from all the creeds and a god from all the gods of the world, carefully weighing all the gods of inevitable recurrence and of unalterable power. They will not find another god who has himself been in revolt. Nay (the matter grows too difficult for human speech), but let the atheists themselves choose a god. They will find only one divinity who ever uttered their isolation; only one religion in which God seemed for an instant to be an atheist.</Text></Row>

For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat. This is what the Lord has commanded: 'Gather as much of it as each of you needs, an omer to a person according to the number of persons, all providing for those in their own tents.'" The Israelites did so, some gathering more, some less. But when they measured it with an omer, those who gathered much had nothing over, and those who gathered little had no shortage; they gathered as much as each of them needed. And Moses said to them, "Let no one leave any of it over until morning." But they did not listen to Moses; some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul. And Moses was angry with them. Morning by morning they gathered it, as much as each needed; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, two omers apiece. When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, he said to them, "This is what the Lord has commanded: 'Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy sabbath to the Lord; bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning.'" So they put it aside until morning, as Moses commanded them; and it did not become foul, and there were no worms in it. Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the Lord; today you will not find it in the field. Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is a sabbath, there will be none."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they found none. The Lord said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and instructions? See! The Lord has given you the sabbath, therefore on the sixth day he gives you food for two days; each of you stay where you are; do not leave your place on the seventh day." So the people rested on the seventh day.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The house of Israel called it manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. Moses said, "This is what the Lord has commanded: 'Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, in order that they may see the food with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'" And Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the Lord, to be kept throughout your generations." As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the covenant, for safekeeping. The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a habitable land; they ate manna, until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]—Exodus 16</Text></Row>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_EVERY_SPERM_IS_SACRED_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Unique among major religions, the Roman Catholic Church is opposed to all forms of artificial birth control in the context of marriage. This position dates back to the first centuries of Christianity. Such acts are considered intrinsically disordered because of the belief that all licit sexual acts must be both unitive (express love), and procreative (open to procreation). The only form of birth control permitted is abstinence. Modern scientific methods of "periodic abstinence" such as natural family planning (NFP) were counted as a form of abstinence by Pope Paul VI in his 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae. The following is the condemnation of contraception:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Therefore We base Our words on the first principles of a human and Christian doctrine of marriage when We are obliged once more to declare that the direct interruption of the generative process already begun and, above all, all direct abortion, even for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as lawful means of regulating the number of children. Equally to be condemned, as the magisterium of the Church has affirmed on many occasions, is direct sterilization, whether of the man or of the woman, whether permanent or temporary. Similarly excluded is any action which either before, at the moment of, or after sexual intercourse, is specifically intended to prevent procreation—whether as an end or as a means."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Satirizing this teaching, Monty Python, a British comedy group, wrote and performed a song titled "Every Sperm Is Sacred" for their 1983 film, "The Meaning of Life". It's part of a larger sketch called "The Third World" about a Catholic Yorkshire man and his wife who have sixty-three children, that are about to be sold for scientific experimentation purposes because their parents can no longer afford to care for such a large family with the local mill being closed. When their children ask why they do not use contraception or sterilisation, or why the father does not perform self-castration, their father explains that this is against God's wishes and breaks into song:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are Jews in the world[NEWLINE]There are Buddhists[NEWLINE]There are Hindus and Mormons, and then[NEWLINE]There are those that follow Mohammed, but[NEWLINE]I've never been one of them[NEWLINE]I'm a Roman Catholic,[NEWLINE]And have been since before I was born,[NEWLINE]And the one thing they say about Catholics is:[NEWLINE]They'll take you as soon as you're warm[NEWLINE]You don't have to be a six-footer[NEWLINE]You don't have to have a great brain[NEWLINE]You don't have to have any clothes on You're[NEWLINE]A Catholic the moment Dad came,[NEWLINE]Because[NEWLINE]Every sperm is sacred[NEWLINE]Every sperm is great[NEWLINE]If a sperm is wasted,[NEWLINE]God gets quite irate[NEWLINE]Every sperm is sacred[NEWLINE]Every sperm is great[NEWLINE]If a sperm is wasted,[NEWLINE]God gets quite irate[NEWLINE]Let the heathen spill theirs[NEWLINE]On the dusty ground[NEWLINE]God shall make them pay for[NEWLINE]Each sperm that can't be found[NEWLINE]Every sperm is wanted[NEWLINE]Every sperm is good[NEWLINE]Every sperm is needed[NEWLINE]In your neighbourhood[NEWLINE]Hindu, Taoist, Mormon,[NEWLINE]Spill theirs just anywhere,[NEWLINE]But God loves those who treat their[NEWLINE]Semen with more care[NEWLINE]Every sperm is sacred[NEWLINE]Every sperm is great[NEWLINE]If a sperm is wasted,[NEWLINE]CHILDREN:[NEWLINE]God gets quite irate[NEWLINE]Every sperm is sacred[NEWLINE]BRIDE and GROOM:[NEWLINE]Every sperm is good[NEWLINE]Every sperm is needed[NEWLINE]CARDINALS:[NEWLINE]In your neighbourhood![NEWLINE]Every sperm is useful[NEWLINE]Every sperm is fine[NEWLINE]God needs everybody's[NEWLINE]Mine![NEWLINE]And mine![NEWLINE]And mine![NEWLINE]Let the Pagan spill theirs[NEWLINE]O'er mountain, hill, and plain[NEWLINE]HOLY STATUES:[NEWLINE]God shall strike them down for[NEWLINE]Each sperm that's spilt in vain[NEWLINE]Every sperm is sacred[NEWLINE]Every sperm is good[NEWLINE]Every sperm is needed[NEWLINE]In your neighbourhood[NEWLINE]Every sperm is sacred[NEWLINE]Every sperm is great[NEWLINE]If a sperm is wasted,[NEWLINE]God gets quite iraaaaaate!</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_FOOD_FOR_PEACE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>On July 10, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act, or Public Law 480, an action which simultaneously created the Office of Food for Peace. By signing this legislation, the President laid "the basis for a permanent expansion of our exports of agricultural products with lasting benefits to ourselves and peoples of other lands." The bill, a solution for food-deficient, cash-poor countries, created a secondary foreign market by allowing food-deficient countries to pay for American food imports in their own currencies instead of in U.S. dollars. The law's original purpose was to expand international trade, to promote the economic stability of American agriculture, to make maximum use of surplus agricultural commodities in the furtherance of foreign policy, and to stimulate the expansion of foreign trade in agricultural commodities produced in the United States.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1961, President John F. Kennedy termed the law "Food for Peace," stating, "Food is strength, and food is peace, and food is freedom, and food is a helping hand to people around the world whose good will and friendship we want." Through new amendments, the law switched its focus from disposing of surplus agricultural commodities to addressing humanitarian needs and responding to growing food crisis demands. The day after Kennedy's inauguration, George McGovern was picked to become a special assistant to the president and first director of Kennedy's high-priority Food for Peace program. As director, McGovern urged the greater use of food to enable foreign economic development, saying, "We should thank God that we have a food abundance and use the over-supply among the underprivileged at home and abroad."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By the close of 1961, the Food for Peace program was operating in a dozen countries, and 10 million more people had been fed with American surplus than the year before. In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly expanded school lunch program thanks to Food for Peace; subsequently one in five Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it, and by mid-1962, 35 million children around the world. During an audience in Rome, Pope John XXIII warmly praised McGovern's work, and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers. In addition, McGovern was instrumental in the creation of the United Nations–run World Food Programme in December 1961; it started distributing food to stricken regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.</Text></Row>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_DESERET_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Nineteenth-century leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints consciously created symbols to buttress their community. The most persistent of these pioneer symbols was the beehive.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Its origin may relate to the statement in the Book of Mormon that the Jaredites carried "with them Deseret, which, by interpretation, is a honey bee" (Ether 2:3). The Deseret News (Oct. 11, 1881) described the symbol of the beehive in this way: "The hive and honey bees form our communal coat of arms. It is a significant representation of the industry, harmony, order and frugality of the people, and of the sweet results of their toil, union and intelligent cooperation."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Working together during this early period, individuals contributed specialized talents and skills for building an integrated and well-planned community in a hostile environment. Community, not individuality, created this persistent symbol. The beehive has appeared on public and private Mormon buildings (such as temples, tabernacles, and meetinghouses, Brigham Young's Beehive House, and the mercantile institution ZCMI) as well as in folk art and on furniture. Today it appears as a logo of some Church-related organizations, on the seals of the state of Utah and of two universities, on Church Welfare products, and on some commercial signs in Utah. It links the Mormon community across time while symbolizing the Mormon pioneer past.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_PROTESTANT_WORK_ETHIC_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>The Protestant work ethic is a concept in theology, sociology, economics and history that emphasizes that hard work, discipline and frugality are a result of a person's subscription to the values espoused by the Protestant faith.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This contrasts with the focus upon religious attendance, confession, and ceremonial sacrament in the Roman Catholic tradition. A person does not need to be religious in order to follow the Protestant work ethic, as it is a part of certain cultures impacted by the Protestant Reformation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The concept is often credited with helping to define the societies of Northern, Central and Western Europe. As penal law was enacted to uphold the uniform teachings of the Church of England in England, only various English dissenters held to those values. Among them were the Puritans who emigrated to New England, bringing the work ethic with them and helping define the culture of what would become the United States of America. Immigrants brought their work ethic to the United States of America, Canada, South Africa and other European colonies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The phrase was initially coined in 1904 by Max Weber in his book "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism".</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_SWORD_OF_GIDEON_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>The Lord said to Gideon, "The troops with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand. Israel would only take the credit away from me, saying, 'My own hand has delivered me.' Now therefore proclaim this in the hearing of the troops, 'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home.'" Thus Gideon sifted them out; twenty-two thousand returned, and ten thousand remained. Then the Lord said to Gideon, "The troops are still too many; take them down to the water and I will sift them out for you there. When I say, 'This one shall go with you,' he shall go with you; and when I say, 'This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go." So he brought the troops down to the water; and the Lord said to Gideon, "All those who lap the water with their tongues, as a dog laps, you shall put to one side; all those who kneel down to drink, putting their hands to their mouths, you shall put to the other side." The number of those that lapped was three hundred; but all the rest of the troops knelt down to drink water. Then the Lord said to Gideon, "With the three hundred that lapped I will deliver you, and give the Midianites into your hand. Let all the others go to their homes." So he took the jars of the troops from their hands, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of Israel back to their own tents, but retained the three hundred. The camp of Midian was below him in the valley.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That same night the Lord said to him, "Get up, attack the camp; for I have given it into your hand. But if you fear to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah; and you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to attack the camp." Then he went down with his servant Purah to the outposts of the armed men that were in the camp. The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the east lay along the valley as thick as locusts; and their camels were without number, countless as the sand on the seashore. When Gideon arrived, there was a man telling a dream to his comrade; and he said, "I had a dream, and in it a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell; it turned upside down, and the tent collapsed." And his comrade answered, "This is no other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel; into his hand God has given Midian and all the army."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped; and he returned to the camp of Israel, and said, "Get up; for the Lord has given the army of Midian into your hand." After he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put trumpets into the hands of all of them, and empty jars, with torches inside the jars, he said to them, "Look at me, and do the same; when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then you also blow the trumpets around the whole camp, and shout, 'For the Lord and for Gideon!'"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So Gideon and the hundred who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands. So the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars, holding in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow; and they cried, "A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!" Every man stood in his place all around the camp, and all the men in camp ran; they cried out and fled. When they blew the three hundred trumpets, the Lord set every man's sword against his fellow and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath. And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued after the Midianites.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters against them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan." So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they seized the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan. They captured the two captains of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the wine press of Zeeb, as they pursued the Midianites. They brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]—Judges 7</Text></Row>

Thus you shall do for six days, with seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, the priests blowing the trumpets. When they make a long blast with the ram's horn, as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and all the people shall charge straight ahead." So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and have seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark of the Lord." To the people he said, "Go forward and march around the city; have the armed men pass on before the ark of the Lord."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Lord went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the Lord following them. And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets; the rear guard came after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually. To the people Joshua gave this command: "You shall not shout or let your voice be heard, nor shall you utter a word, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout." So the ark of the Lord went around the city, circling it once; and they came into the camp, and spent the night in the camp.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord. The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord passed on, blowing the trumpets continually. The armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of the Lord, while the trumpets blew continually. On the second day they marched around the city once and then returned to the camp. They did this for six days.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the seventh day they rose early, at dawn, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times. And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout! For the Lord has given you the city. The city and all that is in it shall be devoted to the Lord for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live because she hid the messengers we sent. As for you, keep away from the things devoted to destruction, so as not to covet and take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel an object for destruction, bringing trouble upon it. But all silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are sacred to the Lord; they shall go into the treasury of the Lord." So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpets, they raised a great shout, and the wall fell down flat; so the people charged straight ahead into the city and captured it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]—Joshua 6</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_ECRASEZ_LINFAME_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>The stage was set for the climax of the attack upon Christianity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now Voltaire spread and shouted the watchword of his ire, "Ecrasez l'infame! Crush the infamy!" He had begun to use the phrase in 1759; henceforth he repeated it a hundred times and in a dozen forms; occasionally he used it as a signature. A fresh vitality came to the sixty-eight-year-old Voltaire as he likened himself to Cato Senex crying out, at the end of his speeches to the Roman Senate, "Delenda est Carthago! Deleatur Carthago!" "I have the colic," he wrote, "I suffer much; but when I attack l'infame my pain is relieved." With almost youthful enthusiasm, with incredible confidence, he set himself and a few hesitant aides to assail the most powerful insitution in the history of mankind.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What did he mean by "the infamy"? Did he propose to crush superstition, fanaticism, obscurantism, and persecution? Or was he undertaking to destroy the Catholic Church, or all forms of Christianity, or all religion itself? Hardly the last, for we find him again and again, even amid the campaign, professing his theistic faith, sometimes in terms warm with Voltairean piety. ... He thought he could live contentedly under the Established Church as he had seen it in England. He wrote to d'Alembert "I hope you will destroy l'infame; that is the great point. It must be reduced to the state it has in England; and you will reach this end if you wish. This is the greatest service which we can render to the human race." We may conclude that by l'infame he meant not religion in general, but religion as organized to propagate the superstition and mythology, to control education, and to oppose dissent with censorship and persecution. And such was Christianity as Voltaire saw it in history and in France. ...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now books became weapons, and literature became war. Not only did Diderot, d'Alembert, Helvetius, d'Holbach, Raynal, Morellet, and a dozen others bring their pens to the battle, but Voltaire himself, always dying, became a veritable armory of anticlerical missiles. Within a decade he sent forth some thirty booklets. He had no belief in the efficacy of large volumes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What harm can a book [the Encyclopedie] do that costs a hundred crowns? ... Twenty volumes folio will never create a revolution. It is the little portable volumes of thirty sous that are to be feared. If the Gospel had cost 1200 sesterces the Christian religion would never have been established."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So he poured forth not merely histories and plays but pamphlets, stories, sermons, "instructions," catechisms, diatribes, dialogues, letters, short critiques of the Bible or of Church history, anything that could circulate easily and prick the infame. ... He used over a hundred different pseudonyms; and sometimes, in his impish humor, he ascribed his anti-Christian blasts to "the Archbishop of Canterbury" or "the Archbishop of Paris" or an abbe, a pastor, or a monk. To throw the hounds of heaven off his trail he dedicated one of his pellets to himself. ...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The educated public of France guessed that Voltaire had written them, for he could not disguise his style, but no one proved it. This exciting game became the talk of Paris and Geneva, and its echoes were heard in London, Amsterdam, Berlin, even in Vienna. Never in history had a writer played such hide-and-seek with such powerful enemies, and with such success. A hundred opponents tried to answer him; he rebutted them all, fighting back roughly, sometimes coarsely or unfairly. And he enjoyed it. In the ardor of battle he forgot to die. Indeed, a strange new optimism came upon him, he who had seemed, after the Lisbon earthquake and Candide, to advise surrender to the evils of life as invincible. He dreamed of "philosophy" victorious over a Church entrenched in the needs of the people. If twelve unlettered fisherman had established Christianity, why could not twelve philosophes shake it out of its dogmas and Inquisitions? "Live happy and ecrasez l'infame," he wrote to one of the "brothers," and he assured them, "We will crush it!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]—The Story of Civilization, volume 9: The Age of Voltaire by Will Durant (pg 736–744)</Text></Row>

The song links the judgment of the wicked at the end of the age (Old Testament, Isaiah 63; New Testament, Revelation 19) with the American Civil War. Since that time, it has become an extremely popular and well-known American patriotic song. Of the writing of the lyrics, Howe remembered:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I went to bed that night as usual, and slept, according to my wont, quite soundly. I awoke in the gray of the morning twilight; and as I lay waiting for the dawn, the long lines of the desired poem began to twine themselves in my mind. Having thought out all the stanzas, I said to myself, "I must get up and write these verses down, lest I fall asleep again and forget them." So, with a sudden effort, I sprang out of bed, and found in the dimness an old stump of a pen which I remembered to have used the day before. I scrawled the verses almost without looking at the paper.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The lyrics of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" appear in Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s sermons and speeches, most notably in his speech "How Long, Not Long" from the steps of the Alabama State Capitol building on March 25, 1965, after the 3rd Selma March, and in his final sermon "I've Been to the Mountaintop", delivered in Memphis, Tennessee on the evening of April 3, 1968, the night before his assassination. In fact, the latter sermon, King's last public words, ends with the first lyrics of the "Battle Hymn": "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord."

Despising Greeks, he respected Greece; and when the imperialistic plunderers in the Senate were for waging war upon the rich Rhodes, he made a decisive speech in favor of conciliation. The exception, as all the world knows, was Carthage. Sent there on an official mission in 175 BC, he had been shocked by the rapid recovery of the city from the effects of the Hannibalic war, the fruitful orchards and vineyards, the wealth that poured in from revived commerce, the arms that mounted in the arsenals. On his return he held up before the Senate a bundle of fresh figs that he had plucked in Carthage three days before, as an ominous symbol of her prosperity and her nearness to Rome; and he predicted that if Carthage were left unchecked, she would soon be rich and strong enough to renew the struggle for the mastery of the Mediterranean. From that day, with characteristic pertinacity, he ended all his speeches in the Senate, on whatever subject, with his dour conviction: Ceterum censo delendam esse Carthaginem— "Besides, I think that Carthage must be destroyed." The imperialists in the Senate agreed with him, not so much because they coveted Carthage's trade, as because they saw in the well-irrigated fields of north Africa a new investment for their money, new latifundia to be tilled by new slaves. They awaited eagerly a pretext for the Third Punic War. ... The Senate promised that if Carthage would turn over to the Roman consuls in Sicily 300 children of the noblest families as hostages, and would obey whatever orders the consuls would give, the freedom and territorial integrity of Carthage would be preserved. Secretly the Senate bade the consuls carry out the instructions that they had already received. The Carthaginians gave up their children with forebodings and laments; the relatives crowded the shores in a despondent farewell; at the last moment the mothers tried by force to prevent the ships from sailing ; and some swam out to sea to catch a last glimpse of their children. The consuls sent the hostages to Rome, crossed to Utica with army and fleet, summoned the Carthaginian ambassadors, and required of Carthage the surrender of her remaining ships, a great quantity of grain, and all her engines and weapons of war. When these conditions had been fulfilled, the consuls further demanded that the population of Carthage should retire to ten miles from the city, which was then to be burned to the ground. The ambassadors argued in vain that the destruction of a city which had surrendered hostages and its arms without striking a blow was a treacherous atrocity unknown to history. They offered their own lives as a vicarious atonement; they flung themselves upon the ground and beat the earth with their heads. The consuls replied that the terms were those of the Senate and could not be changed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When the people of Carthage heard what was demanded of them they lost their sanity. Parents mad with grief tore limb from limb the leaders who had advised surrendering the child hostages; others killed those who had counseled the surrender of arms; some dragged the returning ambassadors through the streets and stoned them; some killed whatever Italians could be found in the city; some stood in the empty arsenals and wept. The Carthaginian Senate declared war against Rome and called all adults—men and women, slave or free—to form a new army, and to forge anew weapons of defense. Fury gave them resolution. Public buildings were demolished to provide metal and timber; the statues of cherished gods were melted down to make swords, and the hair of the women was shorn to make ropes. In two months the beleaguered city produced 8000 shields, 18,000 swords, 30,000 spears, 60,000 catapult missiles, and built in its inner harbor a fleet of 120 ships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Three years the city stood siege by land and sea. Again and again the consuls led their armies against the walls, but always they were repulsed; only Scipio Aemilianus, one of the military tribunes, proved resourceful and brave. Late in 147 the Roman Senate and Assembly made him consul and commander, and all men approved. Soon afterward Laelius succeeded in scaling the walls. The Carthaginians, though weakened and decimated by starvation, fought for their city street by street, through six days of slaughter without quarter. Harassed by snipers, Scipio ordered all captured streets to be fired and leveled to the ground. Hundreds of concealed Carthaginians perished in the conflagration. At last the population, reduced from 500,000 to 55,000 surrendered. Hasdrubal, their general, pleaded for his life, which Scipio granted, but his wife, denouncing his cowardice, plunged with her sons into the flames. The survivors were sold as slaves, and the city was turned over to the legions for pillage. Reluctant to raze it, Scipio sent to Rome for final instructions; the Senate replied that not only Carthage, but all such of her dependencies as had stood by her were to be completely destroyed, that the soil should be plowed and sown with salt, and a formal curse laid upon any man who should attempt to build upon the site.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]—The Story of Civilization, volume 3: Caesar and Christ by Will Durant, pg 105–107</Text></Row>

It is the will of God!' When the venerable Roman pontiff heard that, with eyes uplifted to heaven he gave thanks to God and, with his hand commanding silence, said: Most beloved brethren, today is manifest in you what the Lord says in the Gospel, "Where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them." Unless the Lord God had been present in your spirits, all of you would not have uttered the same cry. For, although the cry issued from numerous mouths, yet the origin of the cry was one.

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_CRUSADE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>The Crusades were a series of religious wars sanctioned by the Latin Church in the medieval period. The most commonly known Crusades are the campaigns in the Eastern Mediterranean aimed at recovering the Holy Land from Muslim rule. At the time of the early Crusades the word did not exist, only becoming the leading descriptive term around 1760.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1095, Pope Urban II called for the First Crusade in a sermon at the Council of Clermont. He encouraged military support for the Byzantine Empire and its Emperor, Alexios I, who needed reinforcements for his conflict with westward migrating Turks colonizing Anatolia. One of Urban's aims was to guarantee pilgrims access to the Eastern Mediterranean holy sites that were under Muslim control, but scholars disagree as to whether this was the primary motive for Urban or those who heeded his call. Urban's strategy may have been to unite the Eastern and Western branches of Christendom, which had been divided since the East–West Schism of 1054 and to establish himself as head of the unified Church. The initial success of the Crusade established the first four Crusader states in the Eastern Mediterranean: the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli. The enthusiastic response to Urban's preaching from all classes in Western Europe established a precedent for other Crusades. Volunteers became Crusaders by taking a public vow and receiving plenary indulgences from the Church. Some were hoping for a mass ascension into heaven at Jerusalem or God's forgiveness for all their sins. Others participated to satisfy feudal obligations, obtain glory and honour or to seek economic and political gain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The two-century attempt to recover the Holy Land ended in failure. Following the First Crusade there were six major Crusades and numerous less significant ones. After the last Catholic outposts fell in 1291, there were no more Crusades; but the gains were longer lasting in Northern and Western Europe. The Wendish Crusade and those of the Archbishop of Bremen brought all the North-East Baltic and the tribes of Mecklenburg and Lusatia under Catholic control in the late 12th century. In the early 13th century the Teutonic Order created a Crusader state in Prussia and the French monarchy used the Albigensian Crusade to extend the kingdom to the Mediterranean Sea. The rise of the Ottoman Empire in the late 14th century prompted a Catholic response which led to further defeats at Nicopolis in 1396 and Varna in 1444. Catholic Europe was in chaos and the final pivot of Christian–Islamic relations was marked by two seismic events: the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 and a final conclusive victory for the Spanish over the Moors with the conquest of Granada in 1492. The idea of Crusading continued, not least in the form of the Knights Hospitaller, until the end of the 18th century but the focus of Western European interest moved to the New World.</Text></Row>

In the King James Version these are usually translated as "Lord of Hosts". While not common in the Torah, this name of God is frequently used in the books of the prophets as the writers are trying to persuade their followers to remain loyal to the one who is truly powerful in the face of the armies of the Assyrians and Babylonians who were conquering their lands and forcing them into exile.</Text></Row>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_A_MIGHTY_FORTRESS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>This hymn is often referred to as "the battle hymn" of the Reformation. Many stories have been relayed about its use. Albert Bailey writes, "It was, as Heine said, the Marseillaise of the Reformation... It was sung in the streets... It was sung by poor Protestant emigres on their way to exile, and by martyrs at their death... Gustavus Adolphus ordered it sung by his army before the battle of Leipzig in 1631... Again it was the battle hymn of his army at Lutzen in 1632... It has had a part in countless celebrations commemorating the men and events of the Reformation; and its first line is engraved on the base of Luther's monument at Wittenberg... An imperishable hymn! Not polished and artistically wrought but rugged and strong like Luther himself, whose very words seem like deeds" (The Gospel in Hymns, 316). As you can see, this is a hymn close to the hearts of Protestants and Lutherans, a source of assurance in times of duress and persecution. The text is not restricted, however, to times of actual physical battles. In any time of need, when we do battle with the forces of evil, God is our fortress to hide us and protect us, and the Word that endures forever will fight for us.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Luther wrote this text sometime between 1527 and 1529 as a paraphrase of Psalm 46, though stanza four comes directly from Luther's own persecution experience. The most commonly used English version is a translation by Frederick H. Hedge in 1853. The text is full of battle imagery; this, coupled with the historic use of the hymn in actual battles, can be troubling for Christians who struggle with making sense of warfare. There is a case for arguing that we need to see this hymn in light of the history in which it was written, when Christians were fighting to defend their faith. However, this text also needs to be understood in terms of a spiritual struggle against the powers of darkness. Whether we believe in very real, physical demons and tempters, or less concrete forces, we are in the midst of a very real war between good and evil. That sounds very dramatic and almost clichéd, but it is important to remember. Luther reminds us that we can't simply sit back and watch as horrible things unfold in our world, but that we must join the battle, knowing that God is on our side, and that we fight for a side that has, in a sense, already won.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1 A mighty fortress is our God,[NEWLINE]a bulwark never failing;[NEWLINE]our helper he, amid the flood[NEWLINE]of mortal ills prevailing.[NEWLINE]For still our ancient foe[NEWLINE]does seek to work us woe;[NEWLINE]his craft and power are great,[NEWLINE]and armed with cruel hate,[NEWLINE]on earth is not his equal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2 Did we in our own strength confide,[NEWLINE]our striving would be losing,[NEWLINE]were not the right Man on our side,[NEWLINE]the Man of God's own choosing.[NEWLINE]You ask who that may be?[NEWLINE]Christ Jesus, it is he;[NEWLINE]Lord Sabaoth his name,[NEWLINE]from age to age the same;[NEWLINE]and he must win the battle.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3 And though this world, with devils filled,[NEWLINE]should threaten to undo us,[NEWLINE]we will not fear, for God has willed[NEWLINE]his truth to triumph through us.[NEWLINE]The prince of darkness grim,[NEWLINE]we tremble not for him;[NEWLINE]his rage we can endure,[NEWLINE]for lo! his doom is sure;[NEWLINE]one little word shall fell him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4 That Word above all earthly powers[NEWLINE]no thanks to them abideth;[NEWLINE]the Spirit and the gifts are ours[NEWLINE]through him who with us sideth.[NEWLINE]Let goods and kindred go,[NEWLINE]this mortal life also;[NEWLINE]the body they may kill:[NEWLINE]God's truth abideth still;[NEWLINE]his kingdom is forever! </Text></Row>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_THE_WATCHMAKER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>The watchmaker analogy is a teleological argument which states that a design implies a designer. The analogy has played a prominent role in natural theology and the argument from design, where it was used to support arguments for the existence of God and for the intelligent design of the universe, in both Christianity and Deism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sir Isaac Newton wrote "that the physical laws he had uncovered revealed the mechanical perfection of the workings of the universe to be akin to a watch, wherein the watchmaker is God." But the most famous elaboration of this argument was given by the English clergyman, Christian apologist and philosopher, William Paley in his 1802 book, "Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Paley's book was written in the context of the natural theology tradition. In earlier centuries, theologians such as John Ray and William Derham, as well as philosophers of classical times such as Cicero, argued for the existence and goodness of God from the general well-being of living things and the physical world. "Natural Theology" is an extended argument to that point, constructed around a series of examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; and the existence of finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints that function like hinges or man-made ball-and-socket joints. Paley argues that these all imply an intelligent Creator, and that a system is more than the sum of its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The book was many times republished and remains in print. Charles Darwin took its arguments seriously and responded to them, and contemporary evolutionary biologists like Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins have discussed Paley's book in responding to modern proponents with similar ideas.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_A_FINE_TUNED_UNIVERSE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>The fine-tuned Universe is the proposition that the conditions that allow life in the Universe can occur only when certain universal dimensionless physical constants lie within a very narrow range of values, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe could not be conducive to the establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1913, the chemist Lawrence Joseph Henderson (1878–1942) wrote The Fitness of the Environment, one of the first books to explore concepts of fine tuning in the universe. Henderson discusses the importance of water and the environment with respect to living things, pointing out that life depends entirely on the very specific environmental conditions on Earth, especially with regard to the prevalence and properties of water. In 1961, physicist Robert H. Dicke claimed that certain forces in physics, such as gravity and electromagnetism, must be perfectly fine-tuned for life to exist anywhere in the universe. Fred Hoyle also argued for a fine-tuned universe in his 1984 book Intelligent Universe. He compares "the chance of obtaining even a single functioning protein by chance combination of amino acids to a star system full of blind men solving Rubik's Cube simultaneously".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]John Gribbin and Martin Rees wrote a detailed history and defense of the fine-tuning argument in their book Cosmic Coincidences (1989). According to Gribbin and Rees, "The conditions in our Universe really do seem to be uniquely suitable for life forms like ourselves, and perhaps even for any form of organic complexity. But the question remains—is the Universe tailor-made for man?"</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_IRREDUCIBLE_COMPLEXITY_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Irreducible Complexity is a concept defined by biochemist Michael Behe of a single system which is composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning. Behe uses the mousetrap as an illustrative example of this concept. A mousetrap consists of five interacting pieces: the base, the catch, the spring, the hammer, and the hold-down bar. All of these must be in place for the mousetrap to work, as the removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Likewise, he asserts that biological systems require multiple parts working together in order to function, and he posits that natural selection could not create those kinds of systems because the selectable function is only present when all parts are assembled.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Behe used the eye as an example of an irreducibly complex structure due to its many elaborate and interlocking parts, seemingly all dependent upon one another. Although Behe acknowledged that the evolution of the larger anatomical features of the eye have been well-explained, he pointed out that the complexity of the minute biochemical reactions required at a molecular level for light sensitivity still defies explanation, and that the proposed series of infinitesimal steps to get from patches of photoreceptors to a fully functional eye would actually be considered great, complex leaps in evolution if viewed on the molecular scale.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_NON_OVERLAPPING_MAGISTERIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) is the view that was advocated by the famous paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould that science and religion each represent different areas of inquiry, fact vs. values, so there is a difference between the "nets" over which they have "a legitimate magisterium, or domain of teaching authority," and the two domains do not overlap. He suggests, with examples, that "NOMA enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism" and that it is "a sound position of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In a 1997 essay "Nonoverlapping Magisteria" for Natural History magazine, and later in his book Rocks of Ages (1999), Gould put forward what he described as "a blessedly simple and entirely conventional resolution to... the supposed conflict between science and religion", from his puzzlement over the need and reception of the 1996 address of Pope John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences "Truth Cannot Contradict Truth". He draws the term magisterium from Pope Pius XII's encyclical, Humani generis (1950), and defines it as "a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution" and describes the NOMA principle as "Science tries to document the factual character of the natural world, and to develop theories that coordinate and explain these facts. Religion, on the other hand, operates in the equally important, but utterly different, realm of human purposes, meanings, and values—subjects that the factual domain of science might illuminate, but can never resolve." "These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry (consider, for example, the magisterium of art and the meaning of beauty)."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gould emphasized the legitimacy of each field of endeavor only within its appropriate area of inquiry: "NOMA also cuts both ways. If religion can no longer dictate the nature of factual conclusions residing properly within the magisterium of science, then scientists cannot claim higher insight into moral truth from any superior knowledge of the world's empirical constitution." In the chapter "NOMA Defined and Defended" Gould gave examples of the types of questions appropriate to each area of inquiry, on the topic of "our relationship with other living creatures": "Do humans look so much like apes because we share a recent common ancestor or because creation followed a linear order, with apes representing the step just below us?" represents an inquiry concerning fact, while "Under what conditions (if ever) do we have a right to drive other species to extinction by elimination of their habitats? Do we violate any moral codes when we use genetic technology to place a gene from one creature into the genome of another species?" represent questions in the domain of values. He went on to present "an outline of historical reasons for the existence of conflict, where none should exist;"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In a speech before the American Institute of Biological Sciences, Gould stressed the diplomatic reasons for adopting NOMA as well, stating that "the reason why we support that position is that it happens to be right, logically. But we should also be aware that it is very practical as well if we want to prevail." Gould argued that if indeed the polling data was correct—and that 80 to 90% of Americans believe in a supreme being, and such a belief is misunderstood to be at odds with evolution—then "we have to keep stressing that religion is a different matter, and science is not in any sense opposed to it," otherwise "we're not going to get very far." He did not, however, consider this diplomatic aspect to be paramount, writing in 1997: "NOMA represents a principled position on moral and intellectual grounds, not a mere diplomatic stance."</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_TRUTH_CANNOT_CONTRADICT_TRUTH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Address of Pope John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (October 22, 1996):[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]WITH GREAT PLEASURE I address cordial greeting to you, Mr. President, and to all of you who constitute the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, on the occasion of your plenary assembly. I offer my best wishes in particular to the new academicians, who have come to take part in your work for the first time. I would also like to remember the academicians who died during the past year, whom I commend to the Lord of life.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1. In celebrating the 60th anniversary of the academy's refoundation, I would like to recall the intentions of my predecessor Pius XI, who wished to surround himself with a select group of scholars, relying on them to inform the Holy See in complete freedom about developments in scientific research, and thereby to assist him in his reflections.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He asked those whom he called the Church's "senatus scientificus" to serve the truth. I again extend this same invitation to you today, certain that we will be able to profit from the fruitfulness of a trustful dialogue between the Church and science (cf. Address to the Academy of Sciences, No. 1, Oct. 28, 1986; L'Osservatore Romano, Eng. ed., Nov. 24, 1986, p. 22).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2. I am pleased with the first theme you have chosen, that of the origins of life and evolution, an essential subject which deeply interests the Church, since revelation, for its part, contains teaching concerning the nature and origins of man. How do the conclusions reached by the various scientific disciplines coincide with those contained in the message of revelation? And if, at first sight, there are apparent contradictions, in what direction do we look for their solution? We know, in fact, that truth cannot contradict truth (cf. Leo XIII, encyclical Providentissimus Deus). Moreover, to shed greater light on historical truth, your research on the Church's relations with science between the 16th and 18th centuries is of great importance. During this plenary session, you are undertaking a "reflection on science at the dawn of the third millennium," starting with the identification of the principal problems created by the sciences and which affect humanity's future. With this step you point the way to solutions which will be beneficial to the whole human community. In the domain of inanimate and animate nature, the evolution of science and its applications give rise to new questions. The better the Church's knowledge is of their essential aspects, the more she will understand their impact. Consequently, in accordance with her specific mission she will be able to offer criteria for discerning the moral conduct required of all human beings in view of their integral salvation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3. Before offering you several reflections that more specifically concern the subject of the origin of life and its evolution, I would like to remind you that the magisterium of the Church has already made pronouncements on these matters within the framework of her own competence. I will cite here two interventions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In his encyclical Humani Generis (1950), my predecessor Pius XII had already stated that there was no opposition between evolution and the doctrine of the faith about man and his vocation, on condition that one did not lose sight of several indisputable points.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For my part, when I received those taking part in your academy's plenary assembly on October 31, 1992, I had the opportunity with regard to Galileo to draw attention to the need of a rigorous hermeneutic for the correct interpretation of the inspired word. It is necessary to determine the proper sense of Scripture, while avoiding any unwarranted interpretations that make it say what it does not intend to say. In order to delineate the field of their own study, the exegete and the theologian must keep informed about the results achieved by the natural sciences (cf. AAS 85 1/81993 3/8, pp. 764–772; address to the Pontifical Biblical Commission, April 23, 1993, announcing the document on the The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church: AAS 86 1/81994 3/8, pp. 232–243).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4. Taking into account the state of scientific research at the time as well as of the requirements of theology, the encyclical Humani Generis considered the doctrine of "evolutionism" a serious hypothesis, worthy of investigation and in-depth study equal to that of the opposing hypothesis. Pius XII added two methodological conditions: that this opinion should not be adopted as though it were a certain, proven doctrine and as though one could totally prescind from revelation with regard to the questions it raises. He also spelled out the condition on which this opinion would be compatible with the Christian faith, a point to which I will return. Today, almost half a century after the publication of the encyclical, new knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis. It is indeed remarkable that this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favor of this theory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]What is the significance of such a theory? To address this question is to enter the field of epistemology. A theory is a metascientific elaboration, distinct from the results of observation but consistent with them. By means of it a series of independent data and facts can be related and interpreted in a unified explanation. A theory's validity depends on whether or not it can be verified; it is constantly tested against the facts; wherever it can no longer explain the latter, it shows its limitations and unsuitability. It must then be rethought.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Furthermore, while the formulation of a theory like that of evolution complies with the need for consistency with the observed data, it borrows certain notions from natural philosophy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And, to tell the truth, rather than the theory of evolution, we should speak of several theories of evolution. On the one hand, this plurality has to do with the different explanations advanced for the mechanism of evolution, and on the other, with the various philosophies on which it is based. Hence the existence of materialist, reductionist and spiritualist interpretations. What is to be decided here is the true role of philosophy and, beyond it, of theology.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]5. The Church's magisterium is directly concerned with the question of evolution, for it involves the conception of man: Revelation teaches us that he was created in the image and likeness of God (cf. Gn 1:27–29). The conciliar constitution Gaudium et Spes has magnificently explained this doctrine, which is pivotal to Christian thought. It recalled that man is "the only creature on earth that God has wanted for its own sake" (No. 24). In other terms, the human individual cannot be subordinated as a pure means or a pure instrument, either to the species or to society; he has value per se. He is a person. With his intellect and his will, he is capable of forming a relationship of communion, solidarity and self-giving with his peers. St. Thomas observes that man's likeness to God resides especially in his speculative intellect, for his relationship with the object of his knowledge resembles God's relationship with what he has created (Summa Theologica I-II:3:5, ad 1). But even more, man is called to enter into a relationship of knowledge and love with God himself, a relationship which will find its complete fulfillment beyond time, in eternity. All the depth and grandeur of this vocation are revealed to us in the mystery of the risen Christ (cf. Gaudium et Spes, 22). It is by virtue of his spiritual soul that the whole person possesses such a dignity even in his body. Pius XII stressed this essential point: If the human body take its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God ("animas enim a Deo immediate creari catholica fides nos retinere iubei"; "Humani Generis," 36). Consequently, theories of evolution which, in accordance with the philosophies inspiring them, consider the spirit as emerging from the forces of living matter or as a mere epiphenomenon of this matter, are incompatible with the truth about man. Nor are they able to ground the dignity of the person.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]6. With man, then, we find ourselves in the presence of an ontological difference, an ontological leap, one could say. However, does not the posing of such ontological discontinuity run counter to that physical continuity which seems to be the main thread of research into evolution in the field of physics and chemistry? Consideration of the method used in the various branches of knowledge makes it possible to reconcile two points of view which would seem irreconcilable. The sciences of observation describe and measure the multiple manifestations of life with increasing precision and correlate them with the time line. The moment of transition to the spiritual cannot be the object of this kind of observation, which nevertheless can discover at the experimental level a series of very valuable signs indicating what is specific to the human being. But the experience of metaphysical knowledge, of self-awareness and self-reflection, of moral conscience, freedom, or again of aesthetic and religious experience, falls within the competence of philosophical analysis and reflection, while theology brings out its ultimate meaning according to the Creator's plans.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]7. In conclusion, I would like to call to mind a Gospel truth which can shed a higher light on the horizon of your research into the origins and unfolding of living matter. The Bible in fact bears an extraordinary message of life. It gives us a wise vision of life inasmuch as it describes the loftiest forms of existence. This vision guided me in the encyclical which I dedicated to respect for human life, and which I called precisely "Evangelium Vitae."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is significant that in St. John's Gospel life refers to the divine light which Christ communicates to us. We are called to enter into eternal life, that is to say, into the eternity of divine beatitude. To warn us against the serious temptations threatening us, our Lord quotes the great saying of Deuteronomy: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God" (Dt 8:3; cf.

He went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah,[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The voice of one crying out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways made smooth; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruits worthy of repentance. Do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our ancestor'; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And the crowds asked him, "What then should we do?" In reply he said to them, "Whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise." Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they asked him, "Teacher, what should we do?" He said to them, "Collect no more than the amount prescribed for you." Soldiers also asked him, "And we, what should we do?" He said to them, "Do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the people were filled with expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Messiah, John answered all of them by saying, "I baptize you with water; but one who is more powerful than I is coming; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So, with many other exhortations, he proclaimed the good news to the people. But Herod the ruler, who had been rebuked by him because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and because of all the evil things that Herod had done, added to them all by shutting up John in prison.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]—Luke 3</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_CIRCUIT_RIDERS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Circuit rider clergy, in the earliest years of the United States, were clergy assigned to travel around specific geographic territories to minister to settlers and organize congregations. Circuit riders were clergy in the Methodist Episcopal Church and related denominations, although similar itinerant preachers could be found in other faiths as well, particularly among minority faith groups.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the rough frontier days of the early United States, the pattern of organization in the Methodist Episcopal denomination and its successors worked especially well in the service of rural villages and unorganized settlements. In the Methodist denominations, congregations do not "call" (or employ) a pastor of their own choice. Instead, a bishop "appoints" (assigns) a pastor to a congregation or a group of congregations, and until late in the 20th century, neither pastor nor congregation had any say in the appointment. This meant that in the early days of the United States, as the population developed, Methodist clergy could be appointed to circuits wherever people were settling.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A "circuit" was a geographic area that encompassed two or more local churches. Pastors met each year at "Annual Conference" where their bishops would appoint them either to a new circuit or to remain at the same one. Most often they were moved to another appointment every year. (In 1804, the Methodist Episcopal General Conference decreed that no pastor was to serve the same appointment for more than two consecutive years.) Once a pastor was assigned a circuit, it was his responsibility to conduct worship and visit members of each church in his charge on a regular basis in addition to possibly establishing new churches. He was supervised by a Presiding Elder (now called a District Superintendent) who would visit each charge four times a year (the "Quarterly Conference").[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Riding on horseback between distant churches, these preachers were popularly called "circuit riders" or "saddlebag preachers" although their official role was "traveling clergy" (a term still used in Methodist denominations). Carrying only what could fit in their saddlebags, they traveled through wilderness and villages, preaching every day at any place available (people's cabins, courthouses, fields, meeting houses, even basements and street corners). Unlike clergy in urban areas, Methodist circuit riders were always on the move, needing five to six weeks to cover the longest routes. Their ministerial activity boosted Methodism into the largest Protestant denomination at the time, with 14,986 members and 83 traveling preachers in 1784 and by 1839, 749,216 members served by 3,557 traveling preachers and 5,856 local preachers.</Text></Row>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_GREGORIAN_CHANTS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Gregorian chant is the central tradition of Western plainchant, a form of monophonic, unaccompanied sacred song of the Roman Catholic Church. Gregorian chant developed mainly in western and central Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries, with later additions and redactions. Although popular legend credits Pope Gregory I with inventing Gregorian chant, scholars believe that it arose from a later Carolingian synthesis of Roman chant and Gallican chant.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gregorian chant was traditionally sung by choirs of men and boys in churches, or by men and women of religious orders in their chapels. It is the music of the Roman Rite, performed in the Mass and the monastic Office. Although Gregorian chant supplanted or marginalized the other indigenous plainchant traditions of the Christian West to become the official music of the Christian liturgy, Ambrosian chant still continues in use in Milan, and there are musicologists exploring both that and the Mozarabic chant of Christian Spain. Although Gregorian chant is no longer obligatory, the Roman Catholic Church still officially considers it the music most suitable for worship. During the 20th century, Gregorian chant underwent a musicological and popular resurgence.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_HYMNS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>A hymn is a type of religious song written for the purpose of adoration or prayer. The word hymn derives from the Greek hymnos, which means "a song of praise". A writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist. The singing or composition of hymns is called hymnody. Collections of hymns are known as hymnals or hymn books. Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although most familiar to speakers of English in the context of Christianity, hymns are also prominent in other world religions, especially on the Indian subcontinent. Some hymns survive from antiquity, especially from Egyptian and Greek cultures. Some of the oldest surviving examples of notated music are hymns with Greek texts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Reformation produced a burst of hymn writing and congregational singing. Martin Luther is notable not only as a reformer, but as the author of many hymns including "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God", which is sung today even by Catholics. Luther and his followers often used their hymns to teach tenets of the faith to worshipers. The first Protestant hymnal was published in Bohemia in 1532 by the Unitas Fratrum. Count Zinzendorf, the Lutheran leader of the Moravian Church in the 18th century, wrote some 2,000 hymns. The earlier English writers tended to paraphrase biblical texts, particularly Psalms. Isaac Watts (1674–1748) followed this tradition, but is also credited as having written the first English hymn which was not a direct paraphrase of Scripture. Watts, whose father was an Elder of a dissenter congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus. His father invited him to see what he could do about it; the result was Watts' first hymn, "Behold the glories of the Lamb". Found in few hymnals today, the hymn has eight stanzas in common meter and is based on Revelation 5.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Relying heavily on Scripture, Watts wrote metered texts based on New Testament passages that brought the Christian faith into the songs of the church. Isaac Watts has been called "the father of English hymnody", but Erik Routley sees him more as "the liberator of English hymnody", because his hymns, and hymns like them, moved worshipers beyond singing only Old Testament psalms, inspiring congregations and revitalizing worship.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Later writers took even more freedom, some even including allegory and metaphor in their texts. Charles Wesley's hymns spread Methodist theology, not only within Methodism, but in most Protestant churches. He developed a new focus: expressing one's personal feelings in the relationship with God as well as the simple worship seen in older hymns. His contribution, along with the Second Great Awakening in America, led to a new style called gospel and a new explosion of sacred music writing with Fanny Crosby, Lina Sandell, Philip Bliss, Ira D. Sankey, and others who produced testimonial music for revivals, camp meetings, and evangelistic crusades.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_ORATORIOS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>An oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like most operas, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an instrumental ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theater, while oratorio is strictly a concert piece. In an oratorio the choir often plays a central role, and there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. Another difference is in the subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers also looked to the lives of saints. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences.</Text></Row>

It is usually, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral. Musical settings of the propers of the Requiem Mass are also called Requiems, and the term has subsequently been applied to other musical compositions associated with death, dying, and mourning, even when they lack religious or liturgical relevance. The Mass and its settings draw their name from the introit of the liturgy, which begins with the words "Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine" — "Grant them eternal rest, O Lord".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Requiem Mass is notable for the large number of musical compositions that it has inspired, including settings by Mozart, Verdi, Berlioz, Dvorak, Faure, Durufle, and others. Originally, such compositions were meant to be performed in liturgical service, with monophonic chant. Eventually, the dramatic character of the text began to appeal to composers to an extent that they made the requiem a genre of its own, and the compositions of composers such as Verdi are essentially concert pieces rather than liturgical works.</Text></Row>

And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head, and he lay down in that place to sleep. Then he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it..."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The hymn is often used at the funerals of U.S. Presidents and was the alleged last song the band on RMS Titanic played before the ship sank.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]CNN's founder Ted Turner, at the launch of the channel in 1980, promised: "We won't be signing off until the world ends. ... We'll be ... covering it live. ... [And] when the end of the world comes, we'll play 'Nearer My God to Thee' before we sign off." Turner commissioned a video recording of the hymn for this purpose, played by a military marching band, which he sometimes played for reporters.

The premiere took place in Vienna on May 7, 1824, and despite its unpracticed and under-rehearsed presentation, the audience was ecstatic. At the end of the performance, it was said that Beethoven continued conducting even though the music had ended. One of the soloists stopped him and turned him around to accept his applause. The audience was aware of Beethoven's health and hearing loss, so in addition to clapping, they threw their hats and scarves in the air so that he could see their overwhelming approval.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This symphony is considered by many leading musicologists to be one of the greatest works in western music. It was the first symphony by a major composer to include the human voice and required an orchestra bigger than any other at the time. The premier was a major turning point for classical music, igniting the Romantic Period, where composers began breaking the rules of composition and exploring the use of large ensembles, extreme emotion, and unconventional orchestration. The tune for the "Ode to Joy" section of the symphony was adopted as the Anthem of Europe by the Council of Europe in 1972 and subsequently by the European Union.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]O friends, no more of these sounds![NEWLINE]Let us sing more cheerful songs,[NEWLINE]More songs full of joy![NEWLINE]Joy![NEWLINE]Joy![NEWLINE]Joy, bright spark of divinity,[NEWLINE]Daughter of Elysium,[NEWLINE]Fire-inspired we tread[NEWLINE]Within thy sanctuary.[NEWLINE]Thy magic power re-unites[NEWLINE]All that custom has divided,[NEWLINE]All men become brothers,[NEWLINE]Under the sway of thy gentle wings.[NEWLINE]Whoever has created[NEWLINE]An abiding friendship,[NEWLINE]Or has won[NEWLINE]A true and loving wife,[NEWLINE]All who can call at least one soul theirs,[NEWLINE]Join our song of praise;[NEWLINE]But those who cannot must creep tearfully[NEWLINE]Away from our circle.[NEWLINE]All creatures drink of joy[NEWLINE]At natures breast.[NEWLINE]Just and unjust[NEWLINE]Alike taste of her gift;[NEWLINE]She gave us kisses and the fruit of the vine,[NEWLINE]A tried friend to the end.[NEWLINE]Even the worm can feel contentment,[NEWLINE]And the cherub stands before God![NEWLINE]Gladly, like the heavenly bodies[NEWLINE]Which He sent on their courses[NEWLINE]Through the splendor of the firmament;[NEWLINE]Thus, brothers, you should run your race,[NEWLINE]Like a hero going to victory![NEWLINE]You millions, I embrace you.[NEWLINE]This kiss is for all the world![NEWLINE]Brothers, above the starry canopy[NEWLINE]There must dwell a loving father.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Do you fall in worship, you millions?[NEWLINE]World, do you know your creator?[NEWLINE]Seek Him in the heavens;[NEWLINE]Above the stars must he dwell.</Text></Row>

After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Handel's reputation in England, where he had lived since 1712, had been established through his compositions of Italian opera. He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste; Messiah was his sixth work in this genre. Although its structure resembles that of opera, it is not in dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. Instead, the text is an extended reflection on Jesus as the Messiah called Christ. The text begins in Part I with prophecies by Isaiah and others, and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds, the only scene taken from the Gospels.

Food that may be consumed is termed kosher in English, from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of a Hebrew term meaning "fit" (in this context, fit for consumption).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Torah permits only land animals which both chew the cud and have cloven hooves. Four animals, the hare, hyrax, camel, and pig, are specifically identified as being forbidden because they possess only one of the above characteristics: the hare, hyrax and camel are hindgut fermenters, while the pig has a cloven hoof. The Torah lists winged creatures which may not be consumed, mainly birds of prey, fish-eating water-birds, and bats. The Torah permits fish residing in "the waters" (seas and rivers) only having both fins and scales. The Torah forbids creeping things that crawl the earth and "flying creeping things", with four exceptions: two types of locust, the beetle/cricket, and the grasshopper.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In addition to meat, products of forbidden species and from unhealthy animals were banned by the Talmudic writers. This included eggs (including fish roe) and milk, as well as derived products such as cheese and jelly, but did not include materials merely "manufactured" or "gathered" by animals, such as honey. According to the rabbinical writers, eggs from ritually pure animals would always be prolate ("pointy") at one end and oblate ("rounded") at the other, helping to reduce uncertainty about whether consumption was permitted or not.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some scholars have conjectured that the Jewish concept of "unclean animals" arose out of public health concerns by community leaders, since, in the conditions of the times, some of those animals are indeed more likely to cause food poisoning or transmit diseases to people who consume them.</Text></Row>

The original reference was to the gathering of mendicants who spent much of their time traveling.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Technically, a "monastery" or "nunnery" is a community of monastics, whereas a "friary" or "convent" is a community of mendicants, and a "canonry" a community of canons regular. The terms "abbey" and "priory" can be applied to both monasteries and canonries; an abbey is headed by an Abbot, and a priory is a lesser dependent house headed by a Prior.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In English usage since about the 19th century the term "convent" almost invariably refers to a community of women, while "monastery" and "friary" are used for men.

Monasteries vary greatly in size, from a small dwelling for only a hermit to vast complexes and estates housing tens or hundreds. Often a monastery complex includes a church, dormitory, cloister, refectory, library, balneary and infirmary. Depending on the location, the monastic order, and the occupation of its inhabitants, the complex may also include a wide range of buildings that facilitate self-sufficiency and service to the community such as a hospice, school, barn, forge, or brewery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In English usage, the term monastery is generally used to denote the buildings of a community of monks where a convent tends to be applied to institutions of female monastics (nuns). Historically, a convent denoted a house of friars (reflecting the Latin), now more commonly called a friary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The word monastery comes from the Greek word for "to live alone" because originally all Christian monks were hermits.

They anticipated Jesus would oppose paying the tax since the grassroots anti-Roman movements (e.g. the Zealots) were already provoking riots in opposition to the tax and being arrested for it by the Romans. On the other hand, if Jesus were to acquiesce to the tax, he would alienate his followers by siding with the hated Romans and their unjust taxation. His brilliant rejoinder echoes throughout history:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then the Pharisees left that place and made plans to trap Jesus in saying something wrong. They sent some of their own followers and some people from the group called Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are an honest man and that you teach the truth about God's way. You are not afraid of what other people think about you, because you pay no attention to who they are. So tell us what you think. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"[NEWLINE]But knowing that these leaders were trying to trick him, Jesus said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?

The central idea is that one need not look elsewhere for opportunity, achievement, or fortune; the resources to achieve all good things are present in one's own community. This theme is developed by an introductory anecdote, credited by Conwell to an Arab guide, about a man who wanted to find diamonds so badly that he sold his property and went off in futile search for them. The new owner of his home discovered that a rich diamond mine was located right there on the property. "Had Ali Hafed remained at home and dug in his own cellar, or underneath his own wheat-fields, or in his own garden, instead of wretchedness, starvation, and death by suicide in a strange land, he would have had 'acres of diamonds.'" Conwell elaborates on the theme through examples of success, genius, service, or other virtues involving ordinary Americans contemporary to his audience: "dig in your own backyard!"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The speech is considered a forerunner of Prosperity theology (aka Prosperity gospel), the movement among some Christians who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Implicitly it contains a connotation that those who aren't prospering materially deserve that situation. As the speech articulated:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I say that you ought to get rich, and it is your duty to get rich ... The men who get rich may be the most honest men you find in the community. Let me say here clearly ... ninety-eight out of one hundred of the rich men of America are honest. That is why they are rich. That is why they are trusted with money. That is why they carry on great enterprises and find plenty of people to work with them. It is because they are honest men. ... I sympathize with the poor, but the number of poor who are to be sympathized with is very small. To sympathize with a man whom God has punished for his sins ... is to do wrong. ... Let us remember there is not a poor person in the United States who was not made poor by his own shortcomings..."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Conwell's capacity to establish Temple University and his other civic projects largely derived from the income that he earned from this speech. Before his death in 1925, Conwell delivered it at least 6,152 times around the world.</Text></Row>

The article asserts that it is the duty of the wealthy to give all their surplus wealth to charitiable causes within their lifetime. It is disgraceful to die rich. Much of the essay discusses where and how charitiable giving is most effective, and since neither government nor offspring have proven to be good trustees of large endowments, he concludes that the rich man himself is responsible to make sure his fortune is distributed in the most efficacious way. Simultaneously, he advocates that the government should heavily tax large estates left at death as a means of publicly shaming the rich who neglect their charitable responsibility and putting the capital to some good use.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_TREASURES_IN_HEAVEN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Multiple times in his ministry, Jesus called people to give up all of their worldly possessions in exchange for "Treasures in Heaven". For example:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal; but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth."[NEWLINE]—Matthew 6:19–21, 24[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which someone found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls; on finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it."[NEWLINE]—Matthew 13:44–46[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.'" And he said to him, "Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth." And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, "You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!" And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, "Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God." And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, "Then who can be saved?" Jesus looked at them and said, "With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Peter began to say to him, "See, we have left everything and followed you." Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first."[NEWLINE]—Mark 10:17–31[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But the rich man then began to scratch his head, for the saying pleased him not. And the Lord said to him: "How can you say, I have fulfilled the law and the prophets? For it is written in the law: Love your neighbor as yourself; and behold, many of your brothers, sons of Abraham, are begrimed with dirt and die of hunger while your house is full of many good things and nothing comes from it to them!"[NEWLINE]—Elaboration to the story of the rich young ruler from the Gospel of the Nazaraens (early 2nd century)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He said to his disciples, "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life? If then you are not able to do so small a thing as that, why do you worry about the rest? Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you—you of little faith! And do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are to drink, and do not keep worrying. For it is the nations of the world that strive after all these things, and your Father knows that you need them. Instead, strive for his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful."[NEWLINE]—Luke 6:29–36[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."[NEWLINE]—Luke 12</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_TETZEL_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Johann Tetzel (1465–1519) was a German Dominican friar and preacher who is remembered by history only because his selling of indulgences near Wittenburg provoked Martin Luther to write his famous Ninety-Five Theses, which in turn ignited the Reformation. Tetzel was known for granting indulgences on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church in exchange for money. According to the church, these indulgences allowed a remission of temporal punishment due to sin. In other words, if you had an indulgence, you (or your loved one) would not be required to spend as much time in purgatory after you die. His oft-quoted saying was:[NEWLINE]As soon as the gold in the casket rings[NEWLINE]The rescued soul to heaven springs[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But the real scandal of Tetzel's ministry was when he took indulgences a step further and sold full forgiveness for sins not yet committed. On that point, Luther told a humorous story, that after Tetzel had received a substantial amount of money at Leipzig, a nobleman asked him if it were possible to receive a letter of indulgence for a future sin. Tetzel quickly answered in the affirmative, insisting that the payment had to be made at once. The nobleman did so and received thereupon letter and seal from Tetzel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Tetzel left Leipzig the nobleman attacked him along the way, gave him a thorough beating, and sent him back empty-handed to Leipzig with the comment that this mugging was the future sin which he had in mind. Duke George at first was quite furious about the incident, but when he heard the whole story, he let it go without punishing the nobleman.</Text></Row>

A catechist is someone who is licensed by the bishop on recommendation of the priest and local church council. A century ago, a catechist was a teacher paid by the Church; today, a village catechist is primarily a pastor in the village. In most parts of the Anglican Communion, the priest comes for Holy Communion only when it is possible. The Catechist organises and conducts worship services on Sundays when there is no priest, and throughout the week, the catechist rings the bell that calls people to Morning and Evening Prayer. In most villages, the catechist also works with youth, educates parents and godparents for the Baptism of their children, rehearses those to be confirmed, and serves many other duties.</Text></Row>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_DEACONS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Since the English Reformation, deacons have been the lowest order of clergy: the minor orders (which only came to be clearly defined at the Council of Trent) having been removed from the hierarchy. Although deacons are fully members of the clergy (they wear clerical collars and are styled The Reverend), they are not permitted to preside at the Eucharist, bless people or absolve sins. As these ministries were, and in many ways still are, essential in the life of the church, deacons usually are ordained priests after about a year in the diaconate. Most deacons serve as assistant curates in parish churches, a ministry that usually continues through into their ordination to the priesthood. Some deacons serve as minor canons in cathedrals or as assistant chaplains in a wide range of non-parochial ministry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The responsibilities of deacons involve assisting at worship—particularly setting up the altar for the Eucharist and reading the Gospel. They are also accorded responsibility for pastoral care and community outreach, in keeping with their traditional role of manifesting the church in the world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]So-called vocational deacons are individuals ordained with the intent of staying in the order rather than seeking the priesthood. Such deacons often have secular careers. In these cases, the vocational deacon has the same responsibilities as their transitional colleagues, but without the element of apprenticeship. Many vocational deacons have careers in the social services, where they can manifest their particular ministry of care and outreach.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As different member churches of the Anglican Communion have different policies on the ordination of women, there are some churches (such as the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone) and some dioceses (such as Sydney) in which women may be ordained deacons, but not priests or bishops.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_VICARS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>A vicar is a type of parish priest. Historically, parish priests in the Church of England were divided into vicars, rectors, and perpetual curates. The parish clergy and church were supported by tithes—like a local tax (traditionally, as the etymology of tithe suggests, of ten percent) levied on the personal as well as agricultural output of the parish. Roughly speaking, the distinction was that a rector directly received both the greater and lesser tithes of his parish while a vicar received only the lesser tithes (the greater tithes going to the lay holder, or impropriator, of the living); a perpetual curate with a small cure and often aged or infirm received neither greater nor lesser tithes, and received only a small salary (paid sometimes by the diocese). Today, the roles of a rector and a vicar are essentially the same. Which of the two titles is held by the parish priest is historical. Some parishes have a rector, others a vicar.</Text></Row>

Some dioceses can be very large and others quite small: the Diocese of Cyprus and the Gulf covers several countries and the Diocese of Bolivia covers the whole country, while the Diocese of Sodor and Man covers just the Isle of Man.

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_SOLI_DEO_GLORIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Soli Deo gloria is a Latin term meaning "Glory to God alone". It has been used by artists like Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, and Christoph Graupner to signify that the work was produced for the sake of praising God. The phrase has become one of the five solae propounded to summarize the Reformers' basic beliefs during the Protestant Reformation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a doctrine, it means that everything that is done is for God's glory to the exclusion of mankind's self-glorification and pride. Christians are to be motivated and inspired by God's glory and not their own.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach wrote the initials "S. D. G." at the end of all his church compositions and also applied it to some, but not all, his secular works. This dedication was at times also used by Bach's contemporary George Frideric Handel, e.g. in his Te Deum.

The full phrase attributed to St. Ignatius is "Ad maiorem Dei gloriam inque hominum salutem" or "for the greater glory of God and the salvation of humanity." It is a summary of the idea that any work that is not evil, even one that would normally be considered inconsequential to the spiritual life, can be spiritually meritorious if it is performed in order to give glory to God.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A common Jesuit emblem depicts the mottos surrounding the initials IHS.

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_DESERT_ANCHORITES_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>As the Christian Church became an institution governing millions of men, she tended to adopt a more lenient view of human frailty, and to tolerate, sometimes to share, the pleasures of this world. A minority of Christians held such condescension to be treason to Christ; they resolved to gain heaven by poverty, chastity, and prayer, and retired completely from the world. Monasticism was for many souls a refuge from the chaos and war of the barbarian invasions; there were no taxes in the monastery or the desert cell, no military service, no marital strife, no weary toil; ordination to the priesthood was not required of a monk; and after a few years of peace would come eternal bliss.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Among the anchorites a keen rivalry arose for the austerity championship. "Macarius of Alexandria", says the Abbe Duchesne, "could never hear of any feat of asceticism without at once trying to surpass it." If other monks ate no cooked food in Lent, Macarius ate none for seven years; if some punished themselves with sleeplessness, Macarius could be seen "frantically endeavoring for twenty consecutive nights to keep himself awake." Throughout one Lent he stood upright night and day, and ate nothing except, once a week, a few cabbage leaves; and during this time he continued to work at his basket-weaving trade. For six months he slept in a marsh, and exposed his naked body to poisonous flies. Some monks excelled in feats of solitude; so Serapion inhabited a cave at the bottom of an abyss into which few pilgrims had the hardihood to descend; when Jerome and Paula reached his lair they found a man almost composed of bones, dressed only in a loincloth, face and shoulders covered by uncut hair; his cell was barely large enough for a bed of leaves and a plank; yet this man had lived among the aristocracy of Rome. Some, like Bessarion for forty, Pachomius for fifty, years, never lay down while they slept; some specialized in silence, and went many years without uttering a word; others carried heavy weights wherever they went, or bound their limbs with iron bracelets, greaves, or chains. Many proudly recorded the number of years since they had looked upon a woman's face. Nearly all anchorites lived—some to a great age—on a narrow range of food. Jerome tells of monks who subsisted exclusively on figs or on barley bread. When Macarius was ill someone brought him grapes; unwilling so to indulge himself he sent them to another hermit, who sent them to another; and so they made the rounds of the desert (Rufinus assures us) until they came back intact to Macarius. The pilgrims who flocked from all quarters of the Christian world to see the monks of the East credited them with miracles as remarkable as those of Christ. They could cure diseases or repel demons by a touch or a word, tame serpents or lions with a look or a prayer, and cross the Nile on the back of a crocodile. The relics of the anchorites became the most precious possession of Christian churches, and are treasured in them to this day.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the monasteries the abbot required absolute obedience, and tested novices with impossible commands. One abbot (story says) ordered a novice to leap into a raging furnace; the novice obeyed; the flame, we are informed, parted to let him pass. Another monk was told to plant the abbot's walking stick in the earth and water it till it flowered; for years he walked daily to the Nile, two miles away, to draw water to pour upon the stick; in the third year God took pity on him and the stick bloomed. Work was prescribed for the monks, says Jerome, "lest they be led astray by dangerous imaginings." Some tilled fields, some tended gardens, wove mats or baskets, carved wooden shoes, or copied manuscripts; many ancient classics were preserved by their pens. Most Egyptian monks, however, were innocent of letters, and scorned secular knowledge as a futile conceit. Many of them considered cleanliness hostile to godliness; the virgin Silvia refused to wash any part of her body except her fingers; in a convent of 130 nuns none ever bathed, or washed the feet. Towards the end of the fourth century, however, the monks became resigned to water, and the abbot Alexander, scorning this decadence, looked back longingly to the time when monks "never washed the face."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Near East rivaled Egypt in the number and marvels of its monks and nuns. Jerusalem and Antioch were meshed with monastic communities or cells. The Syrian desert was peopled with anchorites; some of them, like Hindu fakirs, bound themselves with chains to immovable rocks, others disdained so settled a habitation, and roamed over the mountains eating grass. Simeon Stylites (390?–459), we are told, used to go without food through the forty days of Lent; during one Lent he was, at his own insistence, walled up in an enclosure with a little bread and water; on Easter he was unwalled, and the bread and the water were found untouched. At Kalat Seman, in northern Syria, about 421, Simeon built himself a column six feet high and lived on it. Ashamed of his moderation, he built and lived on ever taller columns, until he made his permanent abode on a pillar sixty feet high. Its circumference at the top was little more than three feet; a railing kept the saint from falling to the ground in his sleep. On this perch Simeon lived uninterruptedly for thirty years, exposed to rain and sun and cold. A ladder enabled disciples to take him food and remove his waste. He bound himself to the pillar by a rope; the rope became embedded in his flesh, which putrefied around it, stank, and teemed with worms; Simeon picked up the worms that fell from his sores, and replaced them there, saying to them, "Eat what God has given you." From his high pulpit he preached sermons to the crowds that came to see him, converted barbarians, performed marvelous cures, played ecclesiastical politics, and shamed the moneylenders into reducing their interest charges from twelve to six percent. His exalted piety created a fashion of pillar hermits, which lasted for twelve centuries, and, in a thoroughly secularized form, persists today.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]—The Story of Civilization, volume 4: The Age of Faith by Will Durant, pages 58–60</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_FULTON_SHEEN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Televangelism is the use of media, specifically radio and television, to communicate a religious message. Televangelists are ministers, whether official or self-proclaimed, who devote a large portion of their ministry to television broadcasting. Some televangelists are also regular pastors or ministers in their own places of worship, while others do not have a conventional congregation as such and solely work through television.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Televangelism began as a uniquely American phenomenon, resulting from a largely deregulated media where access to television networks and cable TV is open to virtually anyone who can afford it, combined with a large Christian population that is able to provide the necessary funding. It became especially popular among Evangelical Protestant audiences, whether independent or organized around Christian denominations. However, the increasing globalization of broadcasting has enabled some American televangelists to reach a wider audience through international broadcast networks, including some that are specifically Christian in nature, such as Trinity Broadcasting Network and The God Channel. Domestically produced televangelism is increasingly present in some other nations such as Brazil.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The word televangelism is a portmanteau of television and evangelism. In 1952, the term was employed by Time magazine referring to the telegenic Roman Catholic Bishop Fulton Sheen as the "first televangelist". Jeffrey K. Hadden and Charles E. Swann have been credited with popularising the word in their 1981 survey Prime Time Preachers: The Rising Power of Televangelism.</Text></Row>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_ETERNAL_FATHER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>The first three stanzas of this hymn appeal to the Trinity with Scripture passages where each Person controlled the sea, imploring "O hear us when we cry to Thee for those in peril on the sea." The first stanza refers to God's discourse with Job, in which the Lord asks "Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb, when I ... said, 'Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed'" (Job 38:8, 11 ESV). The second stanza refers to two occasions when Jesus calmed the raging sea: when He walked on the water (Mark 6:45–52), and when He slept through a storm until His terrified disciples woke Him (Mark 4:35–41). The third stanza alludes to Creation, when "The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters." (Genesis 1:2 ESV) The final stanza summarizes the hymn and promises continued praise "from land and sea."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]William Whiting, an Anglican churchman from Winchester, United Kingdom, wrote this hymn in 1860. Whiting grew up near the ocean on the coasts of England, and at the age of thirty-five had felt his life spared by God when a violent storm nearly claimed the ship he was travelling on, instilling a belief in God's command over the rage and calm of the sea. As headmaster of the Winchester College Choristers' School some years later, he was approached by a student about to travel to the United States, who confided in Whiting an overwhelming fear of the ocean voyage. Whiting shared his experiences of the ocean and wrote the hymn to "anchor his faith". In writing it, Whiting is generally thought to have been inspired by Psalm 107, which describes the power and fury of the seas in great detail:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the mighty waters.[NEWLINE]They saw the works of the Lord, his wonderful deeds in the deep.[NEWLINE]For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves.[NEWLINE]They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted away.[NEWLINE]—Psalm 107:23–26[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was modified in 1861 by the editors of Hymns Ancient and Modern, where it was first published. Whiting also revised it a few times. It has become a favorite of seafaring people in English-speaking countries, both civilian and military. In America, its affiliation as the "Navy Hymn" is prompted in part by the practice dating from 1879 of concluding the Sunday services at the Naval Academy at Annapolis with the first stanza of this hymn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The tune MELITA is named after the island where Paul was shipwrecked (Acts 28:1 KJV; modern Bible translations have "Malta"). It is a fitting name for a tune associated with a text about safety on the seas. MELITA was composed by John B. Dykes especially for this text in 1861, and they were published together in Hymns Ancient and Modern.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]1 Eternal Father, strong to save,[NEWLINE]Whose arm does bind the restless wave,[NEWLINE]Who bids the mighty ocean deep[NEWLINE]Its own appointed limits keep;[NEWLINE]O hear us when we cry to Thee [NEWLINE]For those in peril on the sea.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]2 O Savior, whose almighty word[NEWLINE]The winds and waves submissive heard,[NEWLINE]Who walked upon the foaming deep,[NEWLINE]And calm amid the rage did sleep;[NEWLINE]O hear us when we cry to Thee [NEWLINE]For those in peril on the sea.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]3 O Holy Spirit, who did brood[NEWLINE]Upon the waters dark and rude,[NEWLINE]And bid their angry tumult cease,[NEWLINE]And give for wild confusion peace;[NEWLINE]O hear us when we cry to Thee [NEWLINE]For those in peril on the sea.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]4 O Trinity of love and pow'r,[NEWLINE]Your children shield in danger's hour;[NEWLINE]From rock and tempest, fire, and foe,[NEWLINE]Protect them where-so-e'er they go;[NEWLINE]Thus, evermore shall rise to Thee[NEWLINE]Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.</Text></Row>

The movement began in 1856 and continued until 1860.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Motivated to join their fellow church members in Utah, but lacking funds for full teams of oxen or horses, nearly 3,000 Mormon pioneers from England, Wales, Scotland and Scandinavia made the journey from Iowa or Nebraska to Utah in ten handcart companies. The trek was disastrous for two of the companies, which started their journey dangerously late and were caught by heavy snow and severe temperatures in central Wyoming. Despite a dramatic rescue effort, more than 210 of the 980 pioneers in these two companies died along the way. John Chislett, a survivor, wrote, "Many a father pulled his cart, with his little children on it, until the day preceding his death."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although fewer than 10 percent of the 1846–68 Latter-day Saint emigrants made the journey west using handcarts, the handcart pioneers have become a symbol in LDS culture, representing the faithfulness and sacrifice of the pioneer generation.

All Scientology management organizations are controlled exclusively by members of the Sea Org. David Miscavige, the de facto leader of Scientology, is the highest-ranking Sea Org officer, holding the rank of captain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Sea Org has been described as a paramilitary organization and as a private naval force, having operated several vessels in its past and displaying a maritime tradition. Some ex-members and scholars have described the Sea Org as a totalitarian organization marked by intensive surveillance and a lack of freedom. The Sea Org has also been compared to a monastic organization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Sea Org was established on August 12, 1967, by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Dianetics and Scientology, initially onboard four ships, the Diana, the Athena, the Apollo, and the Excalibur. The Apollo served as the flagship of the Sea Org.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sea Org members make a lifetime commitment to Scientology by signing a billion-year contract that is officially described as a symbolic pledge. In exchange, members are given free room and board, and a small weekly allowance. Sea Org members agree to strict codes of discipline, such as disavowing premarital sex, working long hours (on average at least 100 hours per week) and living in communal housing, referred to as "berthings". They are allowed to marry, but must relinquish their membership if they have or want to raise children.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stephen A. Kent (2001) argues that at least part of the reason for the establishment of the Sea Org was that the Church of Scientology's practices encountered resistance from the American Food and Drug Administration and the IRS, and from the governments of Australia, the United Kingdom, and Rhodesia. Sailing on the high seas meant the church could escape their attention. According to scholar Susan Raine, Hubbard created the Sea Org as a "kind of space navy, melding SF space ideas with Earthbound naval ones." Hubbard biographist Jon Atack recalled a confidential command within Sea Org that claimed that governments of the world were on the verge of collapse.

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_PHARAOH_AND_JOSEPH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile, and there came up out of the Nile seven sleek and fat cows, and they grazed in the reed grass. Then seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile. The ugly and thin cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. And Pharaoh awoke. Then he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk. Then seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them. The thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and it was a dream. In the morning his spirit was troubled; so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "I remember my faults today. Once Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard. We dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own meaning. A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each according to his dream. As he interpreted to us, so it turned out; I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was hurriedly brought out of the dungeon. When he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it." Joseph answered Pharaoh, "It is not I; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer." Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile; and seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass. Then seven other cows came up after them, poor, very ugly, and thin. Never had I seen such ugly ones in all the land of Egypt. The thin and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows, but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had done so, for they were still as ugly as before. Then I awoke. I fell asleep a second time and I saw in my dream seven ears of grain, full and good, growing on one stalk, and seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouting after them; and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. But when I told it to the magicians, there was no one who could explain it to me."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Pharaoh's dreams are one and the same; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one. The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, as are the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind. They are seven years of famine. It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do. There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt. After them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; the famine will consume the land. The plenty will no longer be known in the land because of the famine that will follow, for it will be very grievous. And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about. Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man who is discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land, and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plenteous years. Let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and lay up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to befall the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants. Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find anyone else like this—one in whom is the spirit of God?" So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has shown you all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you. You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command; only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you." And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt." Removing his signet ring from his hand, Pharaoh put it on Joseph's hand; he arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck. He had him ride in the chariot of his second-in-command; and they cried out in front of him, "Bow the knee!" Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt. Moreover Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt." Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as his wife. Thus Joseph gained authority over the land of Egypt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt. During the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly. He gathered up all the food of the seven years when there was plenty in the land of Egypt, and stored up food in the cities; he stored up in every city the food from the fields around it. So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance—like the sand of the sea—that he stopped measuring it; it was beyond measure.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]—Genesis 41</Text></Row>

Prior to his rule, some 42,000 Jews returned to Judah from Babylonian captivity under Zerubbabel. Around 445 BC Nehemiah was a cup-bearer to king Artaxerxes in Persia when he learned that the Jews in Judah were in distress and that the walls of Jerusalem were broken down. He asked the king for permission to return and rebuild the city. Artaxerxes sent him to Judah as governor of the province with a mission to rebuild, letters explaining his support for the venture, and provision for timber from the king's forest. Once there, Nehemiah defied the opposition of Judah's enemies on all sides and rebuilt the walls within 52 days.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He then took measures to repopulate the city and purify the Jewish community, enforcing the cancellation of debt, assisting Ezra to promulgate the law of Moses, and enforcing the divorce of Jewish men from their non-Jewish wives.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After 12 years as governor, during which he ruled with justice and righteousness, he returned to the king in Susa. After some time in Susa he returned to Jerusalem, only to find that the people had fallen back into their evil ways.

Greatly angered, he purified the Temple and the priests and Levites and enforced the observance of the law of Moses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]According to most scholars, Nehemiah was a real historical figure and the Nehemiah Memoir, a name given by scholars to certain portions of the book written in the first person, is historically reliable.</Text></Row>

Yorishiro are used during ceremonies to call the kami for worship. The word itself literally means "approach substitute." Once a yorishiro actually houses a kami, it is called a shintai. Ropes called shimenawa decorated with paper streamers called shide often surround yorishiro to make their sacredness manifest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Yorishiro and their history are intimately connected with the birth of Shinto shrines. Early Japanese did not have the notion of anthropomorphic deities, and felt the presence of spirits in nature and its phenomena. Mountains, forests, rain, wind, lightning and sometimes animals were thought to be charged with spiritual power, and the material manifestations of this power were worshiped as kami. Village councils sought the advice of kami and developed the yorishiro, tools that attracted kami somewhat like a lightning rod, so that the kami could have a physical space to occupy to be accessible to human beings for ceremonies. Village council sessions were held in a quiet spot in the mountains or in a forest near a great tree, rock or other natural object that served as a yorishiro. These sacred places and their yorishiro gradually became the revered shrines of Japan today.</Text></Row>

Jesuits also give retreats, minister in hospitals and parishes, sponsor direct social ministries, and promote ecumenical dialogue.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ignatius of Loyola, a Basque nobleman from the Pyrenees area of northern Spain, founded the society after discerning his spiritual vocation while recovering from a wound sustained in the Battle of Pamplona. He composed the Spiritual Exercises to help others follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. In 1534, Ignatius and six other young men, including Francis Xavier and Peter Faber, gathered and professed vows of poverty, chastity, and later obedience, including a special vow of obedience to the Pope in matters of mission direction and assignment. Ignatius's plan of the order's organization was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540 by a bull containing the "Formula of the Institute".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ignatius was a nobleman who had a military background, and the members of the society were supposed to accept orders anywhere in the world, where they might be required to live in extreme conditions. Accordingly, the opening lines of the founding document declared that the society was founded for "whoever desires to serve as a soldier of God to strive especially for the defence and propagation of the faith and for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine." Jesuits are thus sometimes referred to colloquially as "God's soldiers", "God's marines", or "the Company", which evolved from references to Ignatius' history as a soldier and the society's commitment to accepting orders anywhere and to endure any conditions. The society participated in the Counter-Reformation and, later, in the implementation of the Second Vatican Council.</Text></Row>

The legalisation of Christianity with the Edict of Milan (313) transformed Catholic art, which adopted richer forms such as mosaics and illuminated manuscripts.

The responsibilities for each are often rotated among family members, so that even the youngest may be assisted in presenting a short lesson or devotional on a given topic. Parents often use this night as an opportunity to teach their children how to prepare talks and lessons, as well as how to conduct meetings. Family business for the week may be addressed and the family schedule also reviewed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Leaders of the LDS Church have made the following statements concerning Family Home Evening:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Well-planned family home evenings can be a source of long-lasting joy and influence. These evenings are times for group activity, for organizing, for the expressions of love, for the bearing of testimony, for learning gospel principles, for family fun and recreation, and of all things, for family unity and solidarity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Family home evenings should be scheduled once a week as a time for discussions of gospel principles, recreation, work projects, skits, songs around the piano, games, special refreshments, and family prayers. Like iron links in a chain, this practice will bind a family together, in love, pride, tradition, strength, and loyalty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Monday evenings should be reserved for family home evening. Local leaders should ensure that Church buildings and facilities are closed, that no ward or stake activities are planned for Monday evenings, and that other interruptions to family home evenings be avoided. The primary emphasis of family home evening should be for families to be together to study the gospel. We remind all that the Lord has admonished parents to teach their children the gospel, to pray, and to observe the Sabbath Day. The scriptures are the most important resource for teaching the gospel.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_JOHN_FRUM_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>A cargo cult is a belief system among members of a relatively undeveloped society in which adherents practice superstitious rituals hoping to bring modern goods supplied by a more technologically advanced society. These cults were first described in Melanesia in the wake of contact with advanced Western cultures. The name derives from the belief that various ritualistic acts such as the building of an airplane runway will result in the appearance of material wealth, particularly highly desirable Western goods (i.e., "cargo"), via Western airplanes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]John Frum is a figure associated with cargo cults on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu. He is often depicted as an American World War II serviceman who will bring wealth and prosperity to the people if they follow him. He is sometimes portrayed as black, sometimes as white. Quoting David Attenborough's report of an encounter: "'E look like you. 'E got white face. 'E tall man. 'E live 'long South America."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The movement gained popularity in the early 1940s, when 300,000 American troops were stationed in New Hebrides during World War II, bringing with them an enormous amount of supplies (or "cargo"). After the war and the departure of the Americans, followers of John Frum built symbolic landing strips to encourage American airplanes to land and bring them "cargo". Versions of the cult that emphasize the American connection interpret "John Frum" as a corruption of "John from (America)", and credit the presence of African American soldiers for the idea that John Frum may be black.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_SDG_SHAKER_CELIBACY_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>The United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing, more commonly known as the Shakers, is a Christian sect founded in the 18th century in England. They were initially known as "Shaking Quakers" because of their ecstatic behavior during worship services. Shakers settled in colonial America, with initial settlements in New Lebanon, New York (called Mount Lebanon after 1861). They practice a celibate and communal lifestyle, pacifism, and their model of equality of the sexes, which they institutionalized in their society in the 1780s. They are also known for their simple living, architecture, and furniture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the mid-19th century, an Era of Manifestations resulted in a period of dances, gift drawings, and gift songs inspired by spiritual revelations. At its peak in the mid-19th century, there were 6,000 Shaker believers. By 1920, there were only 12 Shaker communities remaining in the United States. At the present time, there is only one active Shaker village, Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village, which is located in Maine. Their celibacy combined with external and internal societal changes resulted in the thinning of the Shaker community, and consequently many of the other Shaker settlements are now village museums."</Text></Row>

Telegone, daughter of Pharis, bore his son, the king Orsilochus. Through him, Alpheus was the grandfather of Diocles, and great-grandfather of a pair of soldiers, Crethon and Orsilochus, who were slain by Aeneas during the Trojan War.  Alpheus was also the river which Heracles, in the fifth of his labours, rerouted in order to clean the filth from the Augean Stables in a single day, a task which had been presumed to be impossible.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_APHRODITE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Aphrodite is a goddess associated with love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. In Hesiod's Theogony, Aphrodite is born off the coast of Cythera from the foam produced by Uranus's genitals, which his son Cronus has severed and thrown into the sea. In Homer's Iliad, however, she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aphrodite was married to Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths and metalworking. Despite this, Aphrodite was frequently unfaithful to him and had many lovers; in the Odyssey, she is caught in the act of adultery with Ares, the god of war.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_APOLLO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Apollo is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities. The ideal of the kouros (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Among other things, he is the patron defender of herds and flocks. He is also connected with the fertility of cattle.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_ARES_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Ares is the god of war; son of Zeus and Hera. In Greek literature, he often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war, in contrast to his sister, the armored Athena, whose functions as a goddess of intelligence include military strategy and generalship.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Greeks were ambivalent toward Ares: although he embodied the physical valor necessary for success in war, he was a dangerous force, "overwhelming, insatiable in battle, destructive, and man-slaughtering."</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_ARTEMIS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Artemis was the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. She was the goddess of the hunt, wild animals, wilderness, childbirth, virginity and protector of young girls, bringing and relieving disease in women; she often was depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows. The deer and the cypress were sacred to her.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_ATHENA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Athena is a goddess associated with wisdom, craft, weaving, and warfare. She was also a warrior goddess, and was believed to lead soldiers into battle. Athena was also the patron goddess of heroic endeavor; aiding Perseus, Heracles, Bellerophon, and Jason in their adventures.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Athena was born from the head of her father Zeus and was regarded as the protectress of various cities across Greece (particularly the city of Athens). Since the Renaissance, Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and classical learning. Western artists and allegorists have often used Athena as a symbol of freedom and democracy.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_ATLAS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Atlas was a Titan condemned to hold up the sky for eternity. Although associated with various places, he became commonly identified with the Atlas Mountains in northwest Africa (modern-day Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia). Atlas was the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia or Clymene. He had many children, mostly daughters, the Hesperides, the Hyades, the Pleiades, and the nymph Calypso who lived on the island Ogygia. Atlas stood at the ends of the earth towards the west.  'Atlantic Ocean' means 'Sea of Atlas', while 'Atlantis' means 'island of Atlas'.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_DEMETER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Demeter is the goddess of the grain, agriculture, harvest, growth, and nourishment, who presided over grains and the fertility of the earth. Though Demeter is often described simply as the goddess of the harvest, she presided also over the sacred law, and the cycle of life and death.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_DIONYSUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Dionysus is the god of the grape-harvest, winemaking and wine, of fertility, ritual madness, religious ecstasy and theatre. He is a son of Zeus and the mortal Semele, thus semi-divine or heroic. Wine played an important role in Greek culture, and the cult of Dionysus was the main religious focus for its unrestrained consumption. He is a major, popular figure of Greek mythology and religion, and included in some lists of the twelve Olympians, as the last of their number, and the only god born from a mortal mother.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dionysus is represented by city religions as the protector of those who do not belong to conventional society and he thus symbolizes the chaotic, dangerous and unexpected, everything which escapes human reason and which can only be attributed to the unforeseeable action of the gods. As Eleutherios ('the liberator'), his wine, music and ecstatic dance free his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful. Those who partake of his mysteries are possessed and empowered by the god himself. His festivals were the driving force behind the development of Greek theatre.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_GAIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Gaia is the personification of the Earth and one of the Greek primordial deities. Gaia is the ancestral mother of all life: the primal Mother Earth goddess. She is the immediate parent of Uranus (the sky), from whose sexual union she bore the Titans (themselves parents of many of the Olympian gods) and the Giants, and of Pontus (the sea), from whose union she bore the primordial sea gods. Her equivalent in the Roman pantheon was Terra.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_HADES_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Hades was the chthonic god of the underworld, which eventually took his name. He was the eldest son of Cronus and Rhea, although the last son regurgitated by his father. He and his brothers Zeus and Poseidon defeated their father's generation of gods, the Titans, and claimed rulership over the cosmos. Hades received the underworld, Zeus the sky, and Poseidon the sea, with the solid earth available to all three concurrently. Hades was often portrayed with his three-headed guard dog Cerberus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps from fear of pronouncing his name, around the 5th century BC, the Greeks started referring to Hades as Pluto, with a root meaning 'wealthy', considering that from the underground come riches (e.g., fertile crops, precious metals and so on). More elaborate names of the same genre were Ploutodotes or Ploutodoter meaning 'giver of wealth'.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_HELIOS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Helios is the god of the Sun. He is the son of the Titan Hyperion and the Titaness Theia and brother of the goddesses Selene, the moon, and Eos, the dawn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Helios is a handsome young man crowned with the shining aureole of the Sun, who drove the chariot of the sun across the sky each day to earth-circling Oceanus and through the world-ocean returned to the East at night.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_HEPHAESTUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Hephaestus is the Greek god of blacksmiths, metalworking, carpenters, craftsmen, artisans, sculptors, metallurgy, fire, and volcanoes. Hephaestus was either the son of Zeus and Hera or he was Hera's parthenogenous child, rejected by his mother because of his deformity and thrown off Mount Olympus and down to earth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a smithing god, Hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in Olympus. He served as the blacksmith of the gods, and was worshipped in the manufacturing and industrial centers of Greece, particularly Athens.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_HERA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Hera is the goddess of women, marriage, family, and childbirth, one of the Twelve Olympians and the sister-wife of Zeus. She is the daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. Hera rules over Mount Olympus as queen of the gods. A matronly figure, Hera served as both the patroness and protectress of married women, presiding over weddings and blessing marital unions. One of Hera's defining characteristics is her jealous and vengeful nature against Zeus' numerous lovers and illegitimate offspring, as well as the mortals who cross her. Yet she never leaves Zeus...</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_HERMES_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Hermes is the god of trade, heraldry, merchants, commerce, roads, sports, travelers, and athletes; the son of Zeus and the Pleiad Maia, he was the second youngest of the Olympian gods (Dionysus being the youngest).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hermes was the emissary and messenger of the gods. He was also the divine 'trickster' and the god of boundaries and the transgression of boundaries, the patron of herdsmen, thieves, graves, and heralds. He is described as moving freely between the worlds of the mortal and divine, and was the conductor of souls into the afterlife.  He was also viewed as the protector and patron of roads and travelers.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_HESTIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Hestia is a virgin goddess of the hearth, architecture, and the right ordering of domesticity, the family, the home, and the state. She is a daughter of Kronos and Rhea. Hestia received the first offering at every sacrifice in the household. The hearth of the prytaneum functioned as her official sanctuary. With the establishment of a new colony, flame from Hestia's public hearth in the mother city would be carried to the new settlement.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_PAN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Pan is the god of the wild, shepherds and flocks, nature of mountain wilds, rustic music and impromptus, and companion of the nymphs. He has the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat, in the same manner as a faun or satyr. With his homeland in rustic Arcadia, he is also recognized as the god of fields, groves, wooded glens and often affiliated with sex; because of this, Pan is connected to fertility and the season of spring. The ancient Greeks also considered Pan to be the god of theatrical criticism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The pan flute is named after Pan. Syrinx, a forest Nymph attempted to escape the affection of god Pan and was transformed in to water-reed. Then, Pan cut several reeds, placed them in parallel one next to the other, bound them together, and made a melodic musical instrument. Ancient Greeks called this instrument Syrinx, in honour of the Muse, and Pandean, or Pan-pipes and Pan-flute, after Pan. The Syrinx, a predominantly pastoral instrument for the Greeks, was adopted by the Etruscans who played it at their festivals and banquets; the Etruscans called it fistula. The Romans adopted the Syrinx from the Greeks and the Etruscans, and they too played it at their banquets, festivals, as well as in religious and funeral processions.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_PERSEPHONE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Persephone is the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. Homer describes her as the formidable, venerable majestic princess of the underworld, who carries into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead. She became the queen of the underworld through her abduction by and subsequent marriage to Hades, the god of the underworld. Her abduction is the personification of winter, withdrawing each year after harvest.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_POSEIDON_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1"><Text>Poseidon was god of the Sea and other waters; of earthquakes; and of horses. Poseidon was protector of seafarers, and of many cities and colonies. In Homer's Iliad, Poseidon supports the Greeks against the Trojans during the Trojan War. In the Odyssey, during the sea-voyage from Troy back home to Ithaca, the Greek hero Odysseus provokes Poseidon's fury by blinding his son the Cyclops, resulting in Poseidon punishing him with storms, the complete loss of his ship and companions, and a ten-year delay. The island of Atlantis was Poseidon's domain.</Text></Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_RELIGIONS_PAGE_OP_ZEUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2"><Text>Zeus is the sky and thunder god, who rules as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. Zeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He is married to Hera, by whom he is usually said to have fathered Ares, Hebe, and Hephaestus. At the oracle of Dodona, his consort was said to be Dione, by whom he fathered Aphrodite. Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in many godly and heroic offspring, including Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, Minos, and the Muses.</Text></Row>
