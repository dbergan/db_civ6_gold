('LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_MOVEMENT_5_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1', '"Embark" means to go onto a boat, literally coming from Latin, "on the wood" (similar to our word "onboard"). At the start of the game, your land units cannot enter any water tiles. However, once you''ve learned the Sailing technology, Builders will be able to move onto coastal water tiles. After Celestial Navigation, Traders will be able to embark; and after Shipbuilding, all units will be able to embark.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]MOVEMENT[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To embark, you simply move the unit from a shore tile to an adjacent coastal tile... unless there is a cliff between the two. Embarking is like moving onto a tile with a movement cost of 3... it takes 3 movement points (or all your movement points if the unit has fewer than 3). However, moving from a coastal city to the water, or onto a Harbor tile, only costs 1. Once the unit is embarked, it instantly changes its total movement capacity (the denominator on the unit''s card) to reflect the embarked movement. Early in the game this starts at 2, and so embarking can consume all of the unit''s movement even if it had 4 or more movement points on the shore tile. For example, with just the Shipbuilding technology, a Horseman on the shore could show 4/4 movement but have that amount reduced to 0/2 when it moves onto water. This means that its 4 movement points were first converted to 2 (its max embarked movement capacity) before subtracting the 3 for making the move.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the game goes on, technology and wonders can increase the movement capacity for embarked units, and then our 4/4 Horseman would be 1/4 or 1/5 after moving to the water. Unit [ICON_Promotion]Promotions that increase movement usually also increase embarked movement (e.g., "Commando" for Melee, "Pursuit" for Light Cavalry, "Redeploy" for Anti-Cavalry, "Dancing Crane" for Warrior Monks). And some units have promotions that allow them to "ignore" the embarking movement cost (e.g., "Amphibious" for Melee units) which in truth just reduces the cost to 1 movement point instead of 3 to move from shore to water.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Disembarking (coming ashore) has a similar set of rules... where your unit''s movement capacity on land is instantly applied as soon as you come ashore (which may result in losing movement points like the Horseman example earlier). The movement cost for disembarking depends on the tile''s inherent movement cost. Coming ashore onto hills or marsh will take 2 movement, whereas a flat desert or grassland will take just 1. And to the tile''s normal movement cost, you need to add 2 more movement points. However, if the water tile the unit is on is within somebody''s borders, there isn''t an additional cost; it''s just like moving onto that tile as if you were on land. What matters here is the water tile the unit is coming from, **not** the land tile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]COMBAT[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Embarked land units are considered to be in a transport ship and do not have the same combat abilities as they do on land. They can only defend, meaning they can neither initiate an attack, nor counter-attack when being attacked by a naval melee unit. Also, like naval units, embarked units can only heal in friendly waters (though this has been changed for{LOC_GOLD_LABEL}, in which embarked units cannot heal at all). They have a modified Base Combat Strength that''s not determined by the unit''s type, so a Slinger has the same Base Combat Strength as a Tank. The embarked Base Combat Strength is determined by the era its owner is in−that is, the era of the highest technology or civic completed−as follows:[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet](Era: CS)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Ancient: 10[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Classical/Medieval: 15[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Renaissance: 30[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Industrial: 35[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Modern: 50[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Atomic/Information/Future: 55[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Base Combat Strength is increased by 10 or 17 if the unit is a Corps or Army, respectively. Other modifiers apply as normal, but with the exception of "-X Damaged unit," they do not appear in combat previews.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]COMBAT PREVIEWS[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Normally, the combat preview−the side-by-side comparison with the flashing green, yellow, or red healthbars that appears when you select a unit and hover over an enemy unit−is extremely accurate. However, the combat preview for an attack against an embarked unit is an exception and can be misleading. Modifiers that normally appear on the defender''s side of the combat preview are absent, but they do apply. Also, the portion of the defender''s healthbar that is flashing, which shows the damage it''s expected to receive, is inaccurate. It should be increased to what it would be if the omitted modifiers were present.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]SIEGE ATTACKS AGAINST EMBARKED UNITS[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally,{LOC_GOLD_LABEL} has buffed siege units so that they do full damage against embarked units (instead of having a −17 penalty against them because they''re "land units"). We were unable to remove the −17 penalty from the attacker''s side of the preview, so instead, we added a −17 penalty to the embarked unit when it''s being attacked by a siege unit to cancel out the penalty on the attacker''s side. Like other modifiers, the −17 penalty doesn''t show up on the defender''s side of the combat preview, and the flashing portion of the target''s healthbar should be larger than it is.', 'en_US'),

('LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_COMBAT_5_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1', 'All units have 100 health. Units lose health from combat, and can restore lost health by resting (see the article on Combat >> Healing, for details). Combat damage is based on the difference in Combat Strength (CS) between the attacker and the defender. The attacker''s CS, depending on the unit type, can be its melee [ICON_Strength], ranged [ICON_Ranged], or bombard [ICON_Bombard] value, but all units defend with their melee [ICON_Strength] value. Here is how the CS values determine the damage outcome:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You might think that having double or triple the CS of your opponent is good, and it is; but the difference, not the ratio, is what determines the damage dealt. Put another way, a battle between units with 20 CS and 10 CS plays out exactly the same as a battle between units with 90 CS and 80 CS because the difference is 10 in both cases. The formula for damage dealt appears to be:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dmg = Rand*2.6553^(Diff/25), rounded to the nearest integer[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Where Rand is a random integer from 24 to 35, inclusive, and Diff is the difference in CS between the two parties. Diff is positive when the attacker is stronger than the defender and negative when the defender is stronger than the attacker. When an attacker makes a ranged attack, only the defender takes damage. When the attacker makes a melee attack, the defender "attacks back," so to speak, so both parties take damage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Let''s start with a simple example. One Warrior attacks another Warrior, and both have 20 CS. When the attacker and defender have the same CS, Diff is 0. When Diff is 0, (Diff/25) is also 0, so 2.6553 is taken to the power of 0. Anything taken to the power of 0 is 1. The formula in this case thus simplifies to Rand*1. Since Rand is a random integer between 24 and 35, inclusive, the attacker deals between 24 and 35 damage to the defender. Since this is a melee attack, the defender also deals between 24 and 35 damage to the attacker. The two random numbers are independent of one another, meaning the defending Warrior could take 24 damage while the attacking Warrior takes 35, or vice versa, or both could take 32 damage, et cetera.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now let''s look at a slightly more complicated example. Suppose that the attacking Warrior is from a civilization that has just acquired the Discipline policy, and the defending Warrior is a barbarian. The +5 CS bonus from Discipline gives the attacker a total of 25 CS, whereas the defender still has 20 CS. The formula for damage the attacker deals to the defender is thus Rand*2.6553^(5/25), rounded to the nearest integer. 2.6553^(5/25) is 1.2157. So the random integer we get (that''s between 24 and 35) is multiplied by 1.2157, then rounded, to determine the damage the defender takes. The possible outcomes are 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, and 43. The defender will not take 31, 37, or 42 damage, even though those are between the minimum of 29 and the maximum of 43.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because this was a melee attack, the defender also deals damage to the attacker, using a Diff value of −5. That formula is Dmg = Rand*2.6553^(−5/25). 2.6553^(−5/25) is 0.82258. The random integer between 24 and 35 is multiplied by 0.82258, then rounded, to determine the damage the attacker takes. (The possible outcomes are 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. (Notice that the chance of the attacker taking 21 or 25 damage is 1/6, and the chance of each of the other eight possible outcomes is 1/12.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the combat modifiers is "Damaged unit," and as the name suggests, it applies whenever a unit has taken damage. For each point of damage the unit has taken, it suffers a penalty of −0.1 CS. The modifier appears as an integer in the combat preview (and doesn''t appear at all if the unit''s health is at 95 or above), but its true value can be anywhere from 0.0, when the unit is at full health, to −9.9, when the unit is down to 1 health.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Let''s look at another example. Suppose an Archer with 73 health attacks a Scout with 58 health. The Archer''s base [ICON_Ranged]Ranged Strength is 25 CS, and the Scout''s base [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength is 10. At 73 Health, the Archer has a Damaged unit penalty of −2.7 CS. At 58 Health, the Scout has a Damaged unit penalty of −4.2 CS. The total strengths are thus 22.3 CS and 5.8 CS, a difference of 16.5 CS. The formula is Dmg = Rand*2.6553^(16.5/25), or 1.9051. The random integer between 24 and 35 is multiplied by 1.9051, then rounded, to determine the damage the Scout takes. So here the possible outcomes are 46, 48, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, and 67. With 58 damage needed to kill the Scout, there is a 5/12 chance it will die from the attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With this mod enabled, you will notice 12 damage numbers in the combat preview window just under the unit name. These numbers represent the above calculations AND factor in the unit''s health to give you the target''s final health spectrum. For example, with a slinger (at full health) looking at an attack on a scout with 50 health, under the Scout''s name it shows 15 13 12 10 9 7 6 4 3 1 0 0 [BR]. This means that the slinger''s attack will leave the scout with 0 health (dead) in 2 of the 12 possibilities (the "0 0" numbers at the end) or the scout will survive the attack with 1-15 health in the 10 other possibilities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Looking at attacking the same damaged scout with a warrior (at full health) it shows 7 5 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0{LOC_GOLD_LABEL} under the scouts''s name and 87 86 86 85 84 84 83 83 82 82 81 81{LOC_GOLD_LABEL} under the warrior''s. This means the attack has an 8-out-of-12 chance of killing the scout and the warrior''s health after the battle will be in the range of 81-87.', 'en_US'),

Military formations ([ICON_Corps]Corps/Fleets, [ICON_Army]Armies/Armadas) do NOT raise your City Base Strength when they are formed by merging two units, but will raise it if they are purchased or produced from a city with a Military Academy. Also, upgrading an existing Corp/Army to a new type of unit, will apply not just the new unit''s Combat Strength, but also the +10/+17 from the Corp/Army to your City Base Strength. (Make sure the unit isn''t embarked when it gets upgraded.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Several modifiers are added to this City Base Strength to calculate the City Defense Strength, such as:[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+3 Palace Guard" (a free bonus for your capital)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+3 Ideal Terrain" (when the city''s on a hill)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+5 River Defense" (when a unit is using a melee attack across a river)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+2/4/6/etc from Districts" (each of the city''s un-pillaged districts adds +2)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+3/6/9 Wall Defenses" (for Ancient/Medieval/Renaissance Walls, in addition to reducing incoming damage; more on walls later)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+5 {LOC_GOVERNOR_PROMOTION_REDOUBT_NAME} {LOC_GOVERNOR_DESCRIPTOR_PREVIEW_TEXT}" (Victor is the active governor of this city)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+6 {LOC_POLICY_BASTIONS_NAME} {LOC_POLICY_DESCRIPTOR_PREVIEW_TEXT}" (Bastions is an active military policy in the defender''s government)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"-X Damage to city/encampment" (Damage to city health causes it to be weaker.

X will be the difference between the city''s strongest garrisoned unit and the civilization''s City Base Strength. Additional garrisoned units don''t affect the city''s defense, so if you have both a land and a sea unit in the city, only the one with the higher [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength counts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally, it should be mentioned that land ranged units (Slingers, Archers, etc.) inherently do 17 less [ICON_Ranged] Ranged Strength against cities.

This range is determined by the Fighter unit''s movement range and is subject to bonuses like Logistics when the Fighter unit itself is in friendly territory. However, if a Fighter is deployed on, say, the westmost extreme of an air base''s range, it can''t redeploy to the eastmost extreme in one turn; it can only re-deploy as far east as the unit''s movement allows.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once deployed, the aircraft will fly a circular pattern around its Air Protection Range, which includes the tile it was deployed to and each adjacent tile. The Fighter''s ''Deploy'' operation persists from turn-to-turn until the player gives it a new command, similar to the ''Sleep'' and ''Fortify'' unit operations for land units. While deployed, the Fighter will defend against all air attacks, air pillage attempts, and [?nuclear strikes from Silos, Bombers, Subs, Heavy Howitzers?] within its Air Protection Range. Furthermore, enemy land units cannot move onto the deployed tile (i.e. the center tile of the Air Protection Range).
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Even though it''s deployed, a Fighter can still make Air Attacks and Priority Target attacks against enemies within its attack range from the deployed tile. This means that by using Deploy on one turn and an attack command on the next, a Fighter can actually reach targets quite far from its air base. The total distance is the Fighter''s movement range (deploy) + its attack range, i.e. basically double its attack range.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, the Deployed Fighter won''t show up in the normal unit cycle (similar to a Fortified land unit), so you must specifically click on it to make an attack. Immediately after the attack, the Fighter returns to its deployed tile and resumes Air Protection.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fighters don''t heal while deployed (unless you have the Ground Crew [ICON_Promotion] promotion). To heal, you need to leave Deployed mode via the Re-Base operation, which ends the Fighter''s Air Protection. 


{LOC_OT_HEADER}Fighter aircraft can be deployed to a valid hex within their [ICON_Movement] Movement range from a friendly air base.
