To enter into an Alliance, you must first be Declared Friends with the civilization, and both civilizations must have researched the Civil Service civic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are several Alliance types, each one provides different mutual benefits according to its type. The effects of these levels are cumulative, so if you are in a Level 3 Alliance, you also gain the Level 1 and Level 2 effects. When you are in an Alliance with another Player, you gain Alliance Points every turn.  Collecting enough increases your Alliance Level, resulting in more benefits from your Alliances.  You can increase the rate at which you gain Alliance Points by trading with your Ally.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Every Alliance, regardless of its type, provides Open Borders and a Defensive Pact to both parties. Members of an Alliance cannot declare war on each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You may have only one kind of alliance with another civilization, and once you have created that alliance, you cannot have it with another civilization, although you might have another kind of alliance with them. For example, you might have a Research Alliance with Korea, so you cannot make a new Research Alliance with the Cree. You might create a Military, Cultural, Religious, or Economic Alliance with the Cree, however.
